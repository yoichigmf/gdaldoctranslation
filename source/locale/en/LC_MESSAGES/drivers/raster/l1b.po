"GDAL supports NOAA Polar Orbiter Level 1b Data Set format for reading. "
"Now it can read NOAA-9(F) -- NOAA-17(M) datasets. NOTE: only AVHRR "
"instrument supported now, if you want read data from other instruments, "
"write to me (Andrey Kiselev, dron@ak4719.spb.edu). AVHRR LAC/HRPT (1 km "
"resolution) and GAC (4 km resolution) should be processed correctly."

"Note, that GDAL simple affine georeference model completely unsuitable "

"NOAA stores 51 GCPs per scanline both in the LAC and GAC datasets. In "
