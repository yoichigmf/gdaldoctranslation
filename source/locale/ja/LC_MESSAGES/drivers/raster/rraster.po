"This is a read-only reader for the datasets handled by the `R Raster "
"package <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html>`__. "
"Those datasets are made of a .grd file, which is a text header file, and "
"a .gri binary file containing the raster data itself. The .grd is the "
"file opened by GDAL. Starting with GDAL 2.3, the driver will read "
"ratvalues as RAT or color tables. Layer names will be assigned to GDAL "
"band description. The 'creator' and 'created' attributes of the "
"'[general]' section will be assigned to the GDAL 'CREATOR' and 'CREATED' "
"dataset metadata items."
