"The document proposes migrating the GDAL documentation from a Doxygen to "
"`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ in `ReadTheDocs "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc74_sphinx.rst:25
msgid ""
"Casual contribution to the GDAL documentation is challenging. Wiki-style "
"contribution is possible through the Trac instance, but that requires "
"getting an OSGeo login, which is a high bar, and the Trac information is "
"disconnected from the primary documentation. Other projects such as PROJ "
"and `MapServer <https://mapserver.org>`__ have seen significant uptick in"
" contributed documentation by adopting Sphinx-based systems, and we hope "
"the adoption of this approach for GDAL will ignite a renaissance of "
"documentation contribution as it did for those projects."

"The current approach has some significant deficiencies that have not been"
" overcome by waiting for new versions of Doxygen to arrive. These "
"include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc74_sphinx.rst:38
msgid ""
"The Doxygen build buries the source of the documentation deep into the "
"source tree, which makes it hard to find where to properly add "
"information."

"The structure of the website is indirect from the source code that "
"creates it."

"New features such as convenient mobile-friendly styling, alternative "
"serializations such as PDF, and tighter API and user-level documentation "
"integration are not within easy reach."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc74_sphinx.rst:46

"Editing of raw HTML means that convenient output of other serialization "
"types, such as PDF, Windows Compiled Help, or manpage output is "

"Doxygen API-style documents are still valuable, and we propose to keep a "

"Existing translations will not be ported. Adaptation and continuation of "
