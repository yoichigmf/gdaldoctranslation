"The document proposes and describes the introduction of a new callback "

msgid ""
"Applications (for example QGIS) may provide a debugging panel that allow "
"users to monitor the SQL command that are sent to the layers stored on "
"databases."

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc89_sql_logging_callback.rst:29
msgid ""
"This panel implemented in QGIS is very useful to identify erroneous or "
"inefficient queries and also made the users more conscious about what is "
"going on in the application when layers are loaded and features are "
"fetched."

"The implementation details are still to be defined, a possible "
"implementation would provide a method to `GDALDataset` that allows client"
" code to set the callback function (with some opaque context to be passed"
" back to client code)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc89_sql_logging_callback.rst:43

"The callback function will then be called from the drivers that make "
"database calls each time a SQL command is sent to the backend, in case of"
" prepared queries the actual SQL after parameter substitutions should be "
"sent."

"The callback may be called by multiple threads in a concurrent way, for "
"this reason the implementation of the callback should be robust to that "
"(use of lock typically). That problem may arise in drivers that use "
"multi-threading as an optimization implementation detail. And this is "
"typically the case of the GeoPackage driver in its Arrow stream "
