"The GTI driver is a driver that allows to handle catalogs with a large "
"number of raster files (called \"tiles\" in the rest of this document, "
"even if a regular tiling is not required by the driver), and build a "
"virtual mosaic from them. Each tile may be in any GDAL supported raster "
"format, and be a file stored on a regular filesystem, or any GDAL "
"supported virtual filesystem (for raster drivers that support such "
"files)."

"The tiles are listed as features of any GDAL supported vector format. Use"

":ref:`GeoPackage <vector.gpkg>`, :ref:`FlatGeoBuf <vector.flatgeobuf>` or"
" :ref:`PostGIS <vector.pg>`. The GTI driver can thus use a larger number "
