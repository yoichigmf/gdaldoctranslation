"This driver works with most Radarsat, JERS-1 and ERS data products, "
"including single look complex products; however, it is unlikely to work "
"for non-Radar CEOS products. The simpler :ref:`raster.ceos` driver is "
"often appropriate for these."

"This driver will attempt to read 15 lat/long GCPS by sampling the per-"
"scanline CEOS superstructure information. In the case of products from "
"the Alaska Satellite Facility, it will obtain corner coordinates from "
"either the map projection record in the case of ScanSAR products, or the "
"facility data record for non-ScanSAR products. It also captures various "
"pieces of metadata from various header files, including:"

"The SAR_CEOS driver also includes some support for SIR-C and PALSAR "
"polarimetric data. The SIR-C format contains an image in compressed "
"scattering matrix form, described `here "
"<http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/software/dcomp/dcomp.html>`__. GDAL "
"decompresses the data as it is read in. The PALSAR format contains bands "
"that correspond almost exactly to elements of the 3x3 Hermitian "
"covariance matrix- see the `ERSDAC-VX-CEOS-004A.pdf "
"<http://www.ersdac.or.jp/palsar/palsar_E.html>`__ document for a complete"
" description (pixel storage is described on page 193). GDAL converts "
"these to complex floating point covariance matrix bands as they are read "
"in. The convention used to represent the covariance matrix in terms of "
"the scattering matrix elements HH, HV (=VH), and VV is indicated below. "
"Note that the non-diagonal elements of the matrix are complex values, "
"while the diagonal values are real (though represented as complex bands)."
