"This RFC covers an improvement to manage sparse datasets, that is to say "

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc63_sparse_datasets_improvements.rst:24
msgid ""
"There are use cases where one needs to read or generate a dataset that "
"covers a large spatial extent, but in which significant parts are not "
"covered by data. There is no way in the GDAL API to quickly know which "
"areas are covered or not by data, hence requiring to process all pixels, "
"which is rather inefficient. Whereas some formats like GeoTIFF, VRT or "
"GeoPackage can potentially give such an information without processing "
"pixels."

"It is thus proposed to add a new method GetDataCoverageStatus() in the "
