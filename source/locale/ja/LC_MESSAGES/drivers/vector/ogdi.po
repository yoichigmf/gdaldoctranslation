"If an OGDI gltp url is opened directly the OGDI 3.1 capabilities for the "

"created for each OGDI family available for each layer in the datastore. "
"For drivers such as VRF this can result in a lot of layers. Each of the "
"layers has an OGR name based on the OGDI name plus an underscore and the "
"family name. For instance a layer might be called "
