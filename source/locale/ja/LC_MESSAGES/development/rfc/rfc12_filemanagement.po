"Some applications using GDAL have a requirement to provide file "
"management operations through the GUI. This includes deleting, renaming, "
"moving and packaging up datasets which often requires operations on "
"several associated files. This RFC introduces an operation on a "
"GDALDataset to identify all the dataset files, and operations to move or "
"copy them."

"The default implementation tests the name of the datasource to see if it "

"If the default overview manager is active, and has overviews, those will "

" for world files, but only those with extensions based on the original "
"files extension (ie. .tfw or .tifw for .tif) but does not search for .wld"

"The POSIX rename() function on which VSIRename() is usually based does "

"file system, but still works between file systems, a new operation will "
"be added to gdal/port. This is the CPLMoveFile() function which will "
"first try a VSIRename(). If that fails it will use CPLCopyFile() to copy "
