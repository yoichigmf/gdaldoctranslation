":file:`libgdalalljni.dylib` / :file:`gdalalljni.dll` native library. To "

"The native gdalalljni library, as well as the core libgdal library (and "
"its dependencies) should be accessible through the mechanism of the "
"operating system to locate shared libraries. Typically on Linux, this "
"means that the path to those libraries should be set in the "
"``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable (or in :file:`/etc/ld.so.conf`)."
" On MacOSX, it should be in the ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment "
