"This format is basically a raw one. There is just one band per files, "
"except in the RGB24 data type where the Red, Green and Blue bands are "
"store interleaved by pixels in the order Blue, Green and Red. The others "
"data type are unsigned 8 bits integer with values from 0 to 255 or signed"
" 16 bits integer with values from -32.768 to 32.767 or 32 bits single "
"precision floating point.32 bits. The description of the file is stored "
"in a accompanying text file, extension RDC."

"The RDC image description file doesn't include color table, or detailed "
"geographic referencing information. The color table if present can be "
"obtained by another accompanying file using the same base name as the RST"
" file and SMP as extension."

"For geographical referencing identification, the RDC file contains "
"information that points to a file that holds the geographic reference "
"details. Those files uses extension REF and Â resides in the same folder "
"as the RST image or more likely in the Idrisi installation folders."

"Therefore the presence or absence of the Idrisi software in the running "
"operation system will determine the way that this driver will work. By "
"setting the environment variable IDRISIDIR pointing to the Idrisi main "
"installation folder will enable GDAL to find more detailed information "
"about geographical reference and projection in the REF files."

"Note that the RST driver recognizes the name convention used in Idrisi "
"for UTM and State Plane geographic reference so it doesn't need to access"
" the REF files. That is the case for RDC file that specify \"utm-30n\" or"
" \"spc87ma1\" in the \"ref. system\" field. Note that exporting to RST in"
" any other geographical reference system will generate a suggested REF "
"content in the comment section of the RDC file."
