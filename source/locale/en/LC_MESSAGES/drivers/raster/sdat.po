"The driver supports both reading and writing (including create, delete, "
"and copy) SAGA GIS binary grids. SAGA binary grid datasets are made of an"
" ASCII header (.SGRD) and a binary data (.SDAT) file with a common "
"basename. The .SDAT file should be selected to access the dataset. "
"Starting with GDAL 2.3, the driver can read compressed .sg-grd-z files "
"that are ZIP archives with .sgrd, .sdat and .prj files."
