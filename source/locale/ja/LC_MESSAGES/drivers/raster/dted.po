"Elevation data in DTED files are organized per columns. This data "
"organization doesn't fit very well with some scanline oriented algorithms"
" and can cause slowdowns, especially for DTED Level 2 datasets. By "
"defining :config:`GDAL_DTED_SINGLE_BLOCK=TRUE`, a whole DTED dataset will"
" be considered as a single block. The first access to the file will be "
"slow, but further accesses will be much quicker. Only use that option if "
"you need to do processing on a whole file."

"The DTED specification (`MIL-PRF-89020B <http://earth-"

"that *horizontal datum shall be the World Geodetic System (WGS 84)*. The "
"vertical datum is defined as EGM96, or EPSG:5773. However, there are "
"still people using old data files georeferenced in WGS 72. A header field"
" indicates the horizontal datum code, so we can detect and handle this "
"situation."
