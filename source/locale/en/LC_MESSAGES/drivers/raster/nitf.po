"GDAL supports reading of several subtypes of NITF (National Imagery "

"Lat/Long extents are read from the IGEOLO (Image GeoLocation) information"
" in the image header if available. If high precision lat/long "
"georeferencing information is available in RPF auxiliary data it will be "
"used in preference to the low precision IGEOLO information. In case a "
"BLOCKA (Image Block Information) instance is found, the higher precision "
"coordinates of BLOCKA are used if the block data covers the complete "
"image - that is the L_LINES field with the row count for that block is "
"equal to the row count of the image. Additionally, all BLOCKA instances "
"are returned as metadata. If GeoSDE TRE (Tagged Record Extension) are "
"available, they will be used to provide higher precision coordinates. If "
"the RPC00B (or RPC00A) TRE is available, it is used to report RPC (Rapid "
"Positioning Capability / Rational Polynomial Coefficients) metadata. "
"Starting with GDAL 2.2, RPC information can be retrieved from \\_rpc.txt "
"files, and they will be used in priority over internal RPC00B values, "
"since the latter have less precision than the ones stored in external "
"\\_rpc.txt."

"On export NITF files are always written as NITF 2.1 with one image and no"

" JPEG2000 compression are also available. Georeferencing can only be "
"written for images using a geographic coordinate system or a UTM WGS84 "
"projection. Coordinates are implicitly treated as WGS84 even if they are "
"actually in a different geographic coordinate system. Pseudo-color tables"

"In addition to the export oriented CreateCopy() API, it is also possible "
