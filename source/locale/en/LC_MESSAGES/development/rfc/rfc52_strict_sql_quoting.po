"Current OGR behavior is generally fine, except in some situations when "
"specifying columns in a SELECT statement or in a WHERE expression. The "
"OGR SQL engine tries to determine the intent with the following rule : if"
" the quoted string matches a column name, then it is assumed to be a "
"column identifier, otherwise a string literal. But sometimes (see "
"`http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/5428 "
"<http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/5428>`__), there are situations where "
"filters such as \"MyField\" = 'MYFIELD' are needed, and currently they "
"always evaluate to TRUE."

"This change affects compatibility in the sense that users that relied on "
"the current permissive behavior will have to adapt their SQL expressions."
" This might be quite tricky to detect as it will not always cause obvious"
" runtime failures. For example \" SELECT "
"'i_thought_this_would_be_interpreted_as_a_column_name_but_now_it_is_a_string_litteral'"
" FROM atable \" will run without error but not produce the previously "
"expected result. So applications will have to review how they build SQL "

"Tests done with SQLite show that it is sometimes tolerant to misuse of "
"quote characters, but in the reverse way as current OGR. So it will "
"accept SELECT \"non_existing_column\" FROM 'atable' and interpret it as "
"SELECT 'non_existing_column' FROM \"atable\". On the contrary, PostgreSQL"
" will not accept it. I'd be rather inclined to follow PostgreSQL stricter"
" approach to keep things simple and understandable: \"string literals "
