"In many places in GDAL source code, multiplications are done to compute "
"the size of the memory buffer to allocate, like raster blocks, scanlines,"
" whole image buffers, etc.. Currently no overflow checking is done, thus "
"leading to potential allocation of not large enough buffers. Overflow can"
" occur when raster dimensions are very large (this can be the case with a"
" WMS raster source for example) or when a dataset is corrupted, "
"intentionnaly or unintentionnaly. This can lead to latter crash."

"This RFC introduces new API to allocate memory when the computation of "
"the size to allocate is based on multiplications. These new API report "
"overflows when they occur. Overflows are detected by checking that "
"((a*b)/b) == a. This does not require to make assumptions on the size of "
"the variable types, their signedness, etc."

"The behavior of VSIMalloc2 and VSIMalloc3 is consistent with the behavior"
" of VSIMalloc. Implementation of already existing memory allocation API "

" not be changed."

":ref:`rfc-8` will be updated to promote new API for safer memory "
"allocation. For example using VSIMalloc2(x, y) instead of doing "
"CPLMalloc(x \\* y) or VSIMalloc(x \\* y)."
