#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc7_vsilapi.rst:16
msgid ""
"To change the API for the VSI*L family of functions to use a new data-"
"type VSILFILE instead of the current FILE."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc7_vsilapi.rst:22
msgid ""
"Currently, GDAL offers two APIs to abstract file access functions "
"(referred to as VSI\\* and VSI\\ *L in this document). Both APIs claim to"
" operate on FILE pointers; however, the VSI*\\ L functions can only "
"operate on FILE pointers created by the VSIFOpenL function. This is "
"because VSIFOpenL returns a pointer to an internal C++ class typecast to "
"a FILE pointer, not an actual FILE pointer. This makes it impossible for "
"the compiler to warn when the VSI\\* and VSI*L functions are "
"inappropriately mixed."

msgid "Proposed Fix"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc7_vsilapi.rst:34
msgid ""
"A new opaque data-type VSILFILE shall be declared. All VSI\\ *L functions"
" shall be changed to use this new type instead of FILE. Additionally, any"
" GDAL code that uses the VSI*\\ L functions must be changed to use this "
"data-type as well."

"A new member VSILFILE\\* fpRawL is added. The existing member FILE\\* "
"fpRaw is kept. The constructors will set the adequate member according to"

"The old FILE\\* GetFP() is adapted to have same behavior as before (can "
"return a standard FILE handle or a VSI*L handle depending on the handle "
"that was passed to the constructor)"
msgstr ""

"However, this would break source compatibility for any existing code "
