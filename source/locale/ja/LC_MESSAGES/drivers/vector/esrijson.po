"This driver can read the JSON output of Feature Service requests "
"following the `GeoServices REST Specification "
"<http://www.esri.com/industries/landing-"
"pages/geoservices/geoservices.html>`__, like implemented by `ArcGIS "
"Server REST API "
"<http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisserver/10.0/apis/rest/index.html>`__. "
"The driver can scroll through such result sets that are spread over "
"multiple pages (for ArcGIS servers >= 10.3). This is automatically "
"enabled if URL does not contain an explicit *resultOffset* parameter. If "
"it contains this parameter and scrolling is still desired, the "
":oo:`FEATURE_SERVER_PAGING` open option must be set to YES. The page size"
" can be explicitly set with the *resultRecordCount* parameter (but is "
"subject to a server limit). If it is not set, OGR will set it to the "
"maximum value allowed by the server."

"Note: for paged requests to work properly, it is generally necessary to "
"add a sort clause on a field, typically the OBJECTID with a "
"\"&orderByFields=OBJECTID+ASC\" parameter in the URL, so that the server "
"returns the results in a reliable way."
