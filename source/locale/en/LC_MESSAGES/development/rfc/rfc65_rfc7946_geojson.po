msgid ""
"GeoJSON has been standardized by the IETF: `RFC 7946 "
"<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946>`__. Updates to the OGR GeoJSON "
"driver are needed so that it may write RFC 7946 GeoJSON."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc65_rfc7946_geojson.rst:25
msgid ""
"The RFC 7946 standard is backwards compatible with the legacy definition "
"of GeoJSON, but has a few differences (see "
"`https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#appendix-B "
"<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#appendix-B>`__). For OGR, the most "
"significant are: removal of \"crs\" (CRS84 only), counter-clockwise "
"winding of polygons, geometry splitting at the antimeridian, and "
"representation of bounding boxes at the antimeridian and poles. Note: RFC"
" 7946 explicitly restricts to 2D and 3D coordinates, and forbid use of "
"the M dimension for example. This was already the case in the existing "
"driver for the GeoJSON 2008 output."

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc65_rfc7946_geojson.rst:35

"Consensus on the gdal-dev list is that developers should be able to "
"require RFC 7946 GeoJSON by configuring layer creation with an option and"
" that it be an all-or-nothing switch."

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc65_rfc7946_geojson.rst:42
msgid ""
"A layer creation option will be added for the GeoJSON driver, e.g., "
"``RFC7946=TRUE``. When \"on\", OGR will write GeoJSON with CRS84 "
"coordinates (reprojecting as needed) with 7 places of precision by "
"default, polygons wound properly, and geometries split at the "
"antimeridian."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc65_rfc7946_geojson.rst:48
msgid ""
"Related to that work, the OGRGeometryFactory::transformWithOptions() "
"method has been improved to better deal with reprojection of geometries "
"from polar projections, and projections that span the antimeridian, to "
"EPSG:4326"
