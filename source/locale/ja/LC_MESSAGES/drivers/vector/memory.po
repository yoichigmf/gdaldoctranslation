"This driver implements read and write access layers of features contained"
" entirely in memory. This is primarily useful as a high performance, and "
"highly malleable working data store. All update options, geometry types, "
"and field types are supported."

"There is no way to open an existing Memory datastore. It must be created "
"with CreateDataSource() and populated and used from that handle. When the"
" datastore is closed all contents are freed and destroyed."

"The driver does not implement spatial or attribute indexing, so spatial "
"and attribute queries are still evaluated against all features. Fetching "
"features by feature id should be very fast (just an array lookup and "
"feature copy)."

"Before GDAL 2.1, feature ids passed to CreateFeature() are preserved "
