"By default, the datatype returned for GRASS ASCII grid datasets by GDAL "
"is autodetected, and set to Float32 for grid with floating point values "
"or Int32 otherwise. This is done by analysing the format of the null "
"value and the first 100k bytes of data of the grid. You can also "
"explicitly specify the datatype by setting the GRASSASCIIGRID_DATATYPE "
"configuration option (Int32, Float32 and Float64 values are supported "
"currently)"
