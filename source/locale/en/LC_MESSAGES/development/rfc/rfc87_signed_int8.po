"This RFC describes the addition of a new GDT_Int8 data type, for signed "

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc87_signed_int8.rst:24
msgid ""
":ref:`rfc-14` introduced in GDAL 1.5.0 a way of specifying that a 8-bit "
"integer should be interpreted as signed, by (ab)using the GDT_Byte type, "
"with the addition of the PIXELTYPE=SIGNEDBYTE metadata item in the "
"IMAGE_STRUCTURE metadata domain of bands for which this is desired."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc87_signed_int8.rst:29
msgid ""
"While this approach avoided the introduction of a new data type, which "
"has consequences internally in the GDAL code base at all places where a "
"\"switch\" is done on a GDALDataType variable, as well as impact on "
"external code using GDAL, this historical approach had the following "
"shortcomings:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc87_signed_int8.rst:34
msgid ""
"drivers that need to support reading signed 8-bit integers must remind to"
" expose the PIXELTYPE=SIGNEDBYTE metadata item."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc87_signed_int8.rst:37
msgid ""
"drivers that need to support writing signed 8-bit integers must provide a"
" creation option for that purpose (generally called PIXELTYPE=SIGNEDBYTE "
"itself)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc87_signed_int8.rst:41
msgid ""
"but more importantly, the absence of a proper data type means that it is "
"easy to forget to test the PIXELTYPE=SIGNEDBYTE metadata item in all "
"places where the value of pixels is taken into account. There were "
"special cases for statistics computations, but most of the other code, "
"such as the overview or warping computation code had no provision for it,"
" and consequently mis-interpreted negative values in the range [-128,-1] "
"as positive values in the range [128,255]."

"It is taken into account in all places in gcore/ and alg/ that have "
"specific behavior depending on the value of GDALDataType. All places that"
