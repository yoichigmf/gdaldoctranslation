"This RFC modifies the GDALRasterBand GetHistogram(), "
"GetDefaultHistogram() and SetDefaultHistogram() methods to accept arrays "
"of 64-bit integer instead of the current arrays of 32-bit integer for "
"bucket counts. It also changes GetRasterSampleOverview() to take a 64-bit"
" integer. This will fix issues when operating on large rasters that have "
"more than 2 billion pixels."
