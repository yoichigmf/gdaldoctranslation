#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc91_dataset_close.rst:28
msgid ""
"A lot of drivers that have write capabilities may do write operations in "
"their destructors, or just close the file descriptor owned by the "
"dataset. Currently there is no clean way of catching errors that might "
"occur. This recently bit `Fiona "
"<https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/issues/1169>` where the GeoJSON "
"driver may emit an error in its dataset destructor when writing the "
"content of a file to a cloud object storage."

"Code that currently wants to detect if GDALClose() causes an error has to"
" do something like the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc91_dataset_close.rst:45
msgid ""
"This is awkward and there is a risk that something in the chain of calls "
"would clean the error state. It is thus desirable for the GDALClose() "
"method to return an error code."
