"Currently GDAL depends on a variety of supporting data files from the "
"`gdal data <http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal/data>`__ directory. The "
"largest part of these are coordinate system dictionaries from EPSG and "
"other sources. It also includes S-57 dictionaries, seed DGN and DXF "
"files, and project logos. Uncompressed it currently comes to roughly "
"1.8MB and it is expected to grow as additional dictionaries are added "
"(for PCI and IAU coordinate systems for instance)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc27_supportdata.rst:38
msgid ""
"The large majority of the support data file access is via the CPL CSV API"
" (gdal/port/cpl_csv.cpp). Finding support data files is done via "
"CPLFindFile(). It turns out these functions are still using the old VSI "
"API which does not support special handlers (like /vsizip/), or in at "
"least one case direct fopen() calls. So the first stage of this RFC is to"
" convert these functions to all use the VSI*L API. A `patch "
"<http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/attachment/wiki/rfc27_supportdata/rfc27_csv_vsil.patch>`__"
" has been prepared that demonstrates the bulk of the required changes. "
"With this patch it is possible to access files from a GDAL_DATA setting "
"like /vsizip//home/warmerda/gdal/data/gdaldata.zip."

"Note that we are explicitly changing the contract about the nature of the"
" FILE\\* passed to functions like CSVReadParseLine() (real FILE\\* vs. "
"VSI\\ *L style FILE*). It is possible, though relatively unlikely that "
"application code, or private driver implementations will be using the SV "
"functions and will need to be changed. This change should be noted in the"
" GDAL 1.8 release notes."

"It is also unclear if there will be bad interactions with the cpl_csv "
"implementation embedded in libgeotiff in some situations, such as when "
"using libgeotiff as an external library. Some review will be needed."

"Another point to investigate is what the performance impact of doing all "
