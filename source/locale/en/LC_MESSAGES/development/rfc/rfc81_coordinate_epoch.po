msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc81_coordinate_epoch.rst:25
msgid ""
"A number of coordinate reference systems (CRS) are called \"dynamic "
"CRS\", that is the coordinates of a point on the surface of the Earth in "
"those CRS may change with time. To be unambiguous the coordinates must "
"always be qualified with the epoch at which they are valid. The "
"coordinate epoch is not necessarily the epoch at which the observation "
"was collected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc81_coordinate_epoch.rst:31
msgid ""
"Examples of dynamic CRS are ``WGS 84 (G1762)``, ``ITRF2014``, "
"``ATRF2014``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc81_coordinate_epoch.rst:33
msgid ""
"The generic EPSG:4326 WGS 84 CRS is also considered dynamic, although it "
"is not recommended to use it due to being based on a datum ensemble whose"
" positional accuracy is 2 meters, but prefer one of its realizations, "
"such as WGS 84 (G1762)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc81_coordinate_epoch.rst:37
msgid ""
"At time of writing, no formats handled by GDAL/OGR have a standardized "
"way of encoding a coordinate epoch. We consequently have made choices how"
" to encode it, admittedly not always elegant, with the aim of being as "
"much as possible backward compatible with existing readers. Those "
"encodings might change if corresponding official specifications evolve to"
" take this concept into account. But, as this is a bit of a chicken-and-"
"egg problem (\"why should we care about storing coordinate epoch if no "
"software can make use of it ?\"), let's start with this initial solution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc81_coordinate_epoch.rst:46
msgid ""
"PROJ can handle a number of time-dependent transformations between static"
" CRS and dynamic CRS, e.g a GDA2020 (static CRS/datum for Australia) to "
"ATRF2014 (dynamic CRS/datum for Australia), taking into account plate "
"motion. Having support to store coordinate epoch will make it easier to "
"have more accurate coordinate transformation."

"Regarding creation of new datasets, no backward incompatibility at all if"
" datasets are created without a coordinate epoch associated to their CRS,"
" as its encoding is only added when needed."

"And when it is used, it is done in a way that shouldn't affect existing "
"reader. The only exception would be the FlatGeobuf format if writing a "
"non-EPSG coded CRS, and with a coordinate epoch (a backport to the 3.3 "
"branch will be done to avoid an error in that case)."
