#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc34_license_policy.rst:43
msgid ""
"GDAL/OGR is distributed under the Non-Reciprocal MIT open source license "
"which facilitates it's use by proprietary and open source applications, "
"and facilitates the inclusion of proprietary format drivers along side "
"the open source format drivers. However, it is still a license violation "
"to distribute reciprocally licensed applications (like QGIS and GRASS) "
"which use GDAL with proprietary licensed drivers (such as the MrSID, ECW "
"or Oracle drivers). Likewise, it is a license violation to distribute "
"proprietary applications with reciprocally licensed drivers such as the "
"GDAL GRASS driver, or the PDF driver."

"This RFC, and the improvements it promotes are intended to facilitate "
"users, applications and drivers setting and following license policies to"

"The general approach proposed is that drivers will declare their license "

"GDALDriverManager and OGRDriverRegistrar classes will apply this "
"information to avoid unintentional license violations."
