"OGR optionally supports reading ESRI Personal GeoDatabase .mdb files via "
"ODBC. Personal GeoDatabase is a Microsoft Access database with a set of "
"tables defined by ESRI for holding geodatabase metadata, and with "
"geometry for features held in a BLOB column in a custom format "
"(essentially Shapefile geometry fragments). This driver accesses the "
"personal geodatabase via ODBC but does not depend on any ESRI middle-"
"ware."

"Personal Geodatabases are accessed by passing the file name of the .mdb "

"In order to facilitate compatibility with different configurations, the "
":config:`PGEO_DRIVER_TEMPLATE` config option was added to provide a way "
"to programmatically set the DSN with the filename as an argument. In "
"cases where the driver name is known, this allows for the construction of"
" the DSN based on that information in a manner similar to the default "
"(used for Windows access to the Microsoft Access Driver)."

"OGR treats all feature tables as layers. Most geometry types should be "
"supported, including 3D data. Measure information (m value) is also "
"supported. Coordinate system information should be properly associated "
"with layers."

"Currently the OGR Personal Geodatabase driver does not take advantage of "
"spatial indexes for fast spatial queries, though that may be added in the"

"The Personal GeoDatabase format does not strictly differentiate between "
"multi and single geometry types for polygon or line layers, and it is "
"possible for a polygon or line layer to contain a mix of both single and "
"multi type geometries. Accordingly, in order to provide predictable "
"geometry types, the GDAL driver will always report the type of a line "
"layer as wkbMultiLineString, and a polygon layer as wkbMultiPolygon. "
"Single-part line or polygon features in the database will be promoted to "
"multilinestrings or multipolygons during reading."
