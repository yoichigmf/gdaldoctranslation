"This RFC addresses handling of NOT NULL constraints and DEFAULT values "
"for OGR fields. NOT NULL constraints are useful to maintain basic data "
"integrity and are handled by most (all?) drivers that have SQL "
"capabilities. Default fields values may be used complementary or "
"independently of NOT NULL constraints to specify the value a field must "
"be assigned to if it is not provided when inserting a feature into the "

"Up to now, OGR fields did not have NOT NULL constraints, i.e. fields in "

" the default, i.e. fields are assumed to be nullable. The OGRFieldDefn "
"class is extended with a boolean attribute bNullable that defaults to "
"TRUE and can be set to FALSE to express a NOT NULL constraint (bNullable "
"has been preferred over bNotNullable to avoid confusion with double "
"negation). Drivers that can translate NOT NULL constraints in their "
"storage will use that attribute to determine if the field definition must"
