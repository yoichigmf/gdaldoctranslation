"Most variants of the AIRSAR Polarimetric Format produced by the AIRSAR "
"Integrated Processor are supported for reading by GDAL. AIRSAR products "
"normally include various associated data files, but only the imagery data"
" themselves is supported. Normally these are named *mission*\\ \\_l.dat "
"(L-Band) or *mission*\\ \\_c.dat (C-Band)."

"AIRSAR format contains a polarimetric image in compressed stokes matrix "
"form. Internally GDAL decompresses the data into a stokes matrix, and "
"then converts that form into a covariance matrix. The returned six bands "
"are the six values needed to define the 3x3 Hermitian covariance matrix. "
"The convention used to represent the covariance matrix in terms of the "
"scattering matrix elements HH, HV (=VH), and VV is indicated below. Note "
"that the non-diagonal elements of the matrix are complex values, while "
"the diagonal values are real (though represented as complex bands)."
