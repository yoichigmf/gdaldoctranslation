"Basis Universal is a \"supercompressed\" GPU texture data interchange "
"system that supports two highly compressed intermediate file formats "
"(.basis or the .KTX2 open standard from the Khronos Group) that can be "
"quickly transcoded to a very wide variety of GPU compressed and "
"uncompressed pixel formats."

"This driver handles textures with the .basis extension. For KTX2, refer "

"Note that while the file format supports direct transcoding to other GPU "
"pixel formats, this GDAL driver supports only conversion between "

"The format supports 2 modes: a high quality mode which is internally "
"based off the `UASTC compressed texture format "
"<https://richg42.blogspot.com/2020/01/uastc-block-format-"
"encoding.html>`_, and the original lower quality mode which is based off "
"a subset of ETC1 called \"ETC1S\". The default is ETC1S. Only input of "
"type Byte and with 1 (grey), 2 (grey+alpha), 3 (RGB) or 4 (RGB + alpha) "
"bands is supported. Refer to "
"https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal for more details on those "
"modes and their options."
