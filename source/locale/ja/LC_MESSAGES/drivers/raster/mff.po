"GDAL includes read, update, and creation support for Vexcel's MFF raster "
"format. MFF dataset consist of a header file (typically with the "
"extension .hdr) and a set of data files with extensions like .x00, .b00 "
"and so on. To open a dataset select the .hdr file."

"MFF files are not normally portable between systems with different byte "
