"Normally the tiles of the base image are stored as described in "

"performance problems if the number of files in a directory is too big, "
"causing gdal_retile not to finish in reasonable time. Using this "
"parameter creates a different output structure. The tiles of the base "
"image are stored in a sub-directory called 0, the pyramids in sub-"
"directories numbered 1,2,.... Within each of these directories another "
"level of sub-directories is created, numbered from 0...n, depending of "
"how many tile rows are needed for each level. Finally, a directory "
"contains only the tiles for one row for a specific level. For large "
"images a performance improvement of a factor N could be achieved."
