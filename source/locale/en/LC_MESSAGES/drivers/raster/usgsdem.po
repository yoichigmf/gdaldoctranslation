"GDAL includes support for reading USGS ASCII DEM files. This is the "
"traditional format used by USGS before being replaced by SDTS, and is the"
" format used for CDED DEM data products from Canada. Most popular "
"variations on USGS DEM files should be supported, including correct "
"recognition of coordinate system, and georeferenced positioning."

"The 7.5 minute (UTM grid) USGS DEM files will generally have regions of "
"missing data around the edges, and these are properly marked with a "
"nodata value. Elevation values in USGS DEM files may be in meters or "
"feet, and this will be indicated by the return value of "
"GDALRasterBand::GetUnitType() (either \"m\" or \"ft\")."

"Note that USGS DEM files are represented as one big tile. This may cause "
"cache thrashing problems if the GDAL tile cache size is small. It will "
"also result in a substantial delay when the first pixel is read as the "
"whole file will be ingested."

"GDAL supports export of geographic (and UTM) USGS DEM and CDED data "
"files, including the ability to generate CDED 2.0 50K products to "
"Canadian federal government specifications."

"Input data must already be sampled in a geographic or UTM coordinate "
"system. By default the entire area of the input file will be output, but "
"for CDED50K products the output file will be sampled at the production "
"specified resolution and on product tile boundaries."

"If the input file has appropriate coordinate system information set, "
"export to specific product formats can take input in different coordinate"
" systems (i.e. from Albers projection to NAD83 geographic for CDED50K "
"production)."

"Example: The following would generate a single CDED50K tile, extracting "
"from the larger DEM coverage yk_3arcsec for a tile with the top left "
