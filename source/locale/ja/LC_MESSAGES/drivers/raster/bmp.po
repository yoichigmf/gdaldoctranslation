"MS Windows Device Independent Bitmaps supported by the Windows kernel and"
" mostly used for storing system decoration images. Due to the nature of "
"the BMP format it has several restrictions and could not be used for "
"general image storing. In particular, you can create only 1-bit "
"monochrome, 8-bit pseudocoloured and 24-bit RGB images only. Even "
"grayscale images must be saved in pseudocolour form."

"This driver supports reading almost any type of the BMP files and could "
"write ones which should be supported on any Windows system. Only single- "
"or three- band files could be saved in BMP file. Input values will be "
"resampled to 8 bit."
