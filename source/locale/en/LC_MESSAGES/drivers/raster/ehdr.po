"GDAL supports reading and writing the ESRI .hdr labeling format, often "
"referred to as ESRI BIL format. Eight, sixteen and thirty-two bit integer"
" raster data types are supported as well as 32 bit floating point. "
"Coordinate systems (from a .prj file), and georeferencing are supported. "
"Unrecognized options in the .hdr file are ignored. To open a dataset "
"select the file with the image file (often with the extension .bil). If "
"present .clr color table files are read, but not written. If present, "
"image.rep file will be read to extract the projection system of "
"SpatioCarte Defense 1.0 raster products."

"This driver does not always do well differentiating between floating "
"point and integer data. The GDAL extension to the .hdr format to "
"differentiate is to add a field named PIXELTYPE with values of either "
"FLOAT, SIGNEDINT or UNSIGNEDINT. In combination with the NBITS field it "
"is possible to described all variations of pixel types."
