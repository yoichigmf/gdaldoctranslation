"OGR optionally supports reading ESRI Personal GeoDatabase .mdb files via "
"ODBC. Personal GeoDatabase is a Microsoft Access database with a set of "
"tables defined by ESRI for holding geodatabase metadata, and with "
"geometry for features held in a BLOB column in a custom format "
"(essentially Shapefile geometry fragments). This driver accesses the "
"personal geodatabase via ODBC but does not depend on any ESRI middle-"
"ware."

"In order to facilitate compatibility with different configurations, the "
":config:`PGEO_DRIVER_TEMPLATE` config option was added to provide a way "
"to programmatically set the DSN with the filename as an argument. In "

"The Personal GeoDatabase format does not strictly differentiate between "
"multi and single geometry types for polygon or line layers, and it is "
"possible for a polygon or line layer to contain a mix of both single and "
"multi type geometries. Accordingly, in order to provide predictable "
"geometry types, the GDAL driver will always report the type of a line "
"layer as wkbMultiLineString, and a polygon layer as wkbMultiPolygon. "
"Single-part line or polygon features in the database will be promoted to "
"multilinestrings or multipolygons during reading."
