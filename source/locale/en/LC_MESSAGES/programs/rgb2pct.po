"This utility will compute an optimal pseudo-color table for a given RGB "
"image using a median cut algorithm on a downsampled RGB histogram.   Then"
" it converts the image into a pseudo-colored image using the color table."
" This conversion utilizes Floyd-Steinberg dithering (error diffusion) to "
"maximize output image visual quality."
