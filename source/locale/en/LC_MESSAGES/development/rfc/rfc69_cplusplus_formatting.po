msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc69_cplusplus_formatting.rst:35
msgid ""
"There is a need to decide on format of GDAL source code and apply such "
"globally consistent format to GDAL C/C++ codebase."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc69_cplusplus_formatting.rst:38
msgid ""
"A uniform, codebase-wide formatting style makes reading and comprehending"
" existing code easier, writing code focused on important aspects of new "
"developments and more pleasant, removes burden during a patch or pull "
"request code reviews and prevents `bikeshedding religious arguments "
"<http://wiki.c2.com/?WhereDoTheBracesGo>`__. Even in small projects, "
"contributing developers discover the problems of working without an "
"agreed upon code format."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc69_cplusplus_formatting.rst:46

"The utility of such guidelines has been proven by many open source "
"software projects."

"The scope of the proposal is specifically limited to formatting style "

"to define C++ code formatting rules for GDAL code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc69_cplusplus_formatting.rst:63
msgid ""
"The ``clang-format`` is a tool to automatically format C/C++ code, so "
"that developers don't need to worry about style issues. Unlike other "
"tools which use own parsers, ``clang-format`` uses the Clang tokenizer "
"and supports the same C++ source code as the Clang compiler. This "
"guarantees correct output is produced and offers unique features (eg. "
"wrapping long lines whether of code, strings, arrays - something which "
"AStyle has no way of doing)."
