"The grid formats have color information embedded in the grid file header."
" This describes how to scale data values to RGB values. When opening in "
"read mode, the driver will report 4 bands - R, G, B and the data band. In"
" reality there is 1 band and the RGB bands are 'virtual', made from "
"scaling data. For this reason, when opening in write mode only 1 band is "
"reported and the RGB bands are unavailable."
