"PNG files are linearly compressed, so random reading of large PNG files "
"can be very inefficient (resulting in many restarts of decompression from"
" the start of the file). The maximum dimension of a PNG file that can be "
"created by GDAL is set to 1,000,000x1,000,000 pixels by libpng."

"Text chunks are translated into metadata, typically with multiple lines "

"recognised as a nodata value in GDAL. Transparent index in paletted "
"images are preserved when the color table is read."

"PNG files can be created with a type of PNG, using the CreateCopy() "

"is set. All pixel types other than 16bit unsigned will be written as "
