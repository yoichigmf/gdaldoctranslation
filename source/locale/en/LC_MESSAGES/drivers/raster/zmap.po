"By default, files are interpreted and written according to the "
"PIXEL_IS_AREA convention. If you define the ZMAP_PIXEL_IS_POINT "
"configuration option to TRUE, the PIXEL_IS_POINT convention will be "
"followed to interpret/write the file (the georeferenced values in the "
"header of the file will then be considered as the coordinate of the "
"center of the pixels). Note that in that case, GDAL will report the "
"extent with its usual PIXEL_IS_AREA convention (the coordinates of the "
"topleft corner as reported by GDAL will be a half-pixel at the top and "
"left of the values that appear in the file)."
