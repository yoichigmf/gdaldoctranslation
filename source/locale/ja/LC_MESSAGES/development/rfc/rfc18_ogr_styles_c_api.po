"OGR has a number of C++ classes that deal with the encoding of style "
"information and attaching that to features. More information is available"
" in the :ref:`ogr_feature_style` document."

"With GDAL/OGR version 1.4.x and older, it was not possible to deal with "
"style information using the C API. This RFC proposes the addition of "
"functions to the C API to manipulate style information in GDAL/OGR 1.5."
