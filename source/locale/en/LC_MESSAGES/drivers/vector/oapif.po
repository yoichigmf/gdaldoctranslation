"OGR needs a fixed schema per layer, but OGC API - Features Core doesn't "
"impose fixed schema. The driver will use the XML schema or JSON schema "
"pointed by the \"describedby\" relationship of a collection, if it "

"The driver will forward any spatial filter set with SetSpatialFilter() to"

"Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference "
"<https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-058/18-058.html>`__ extension. If a server "
"reports a storageCRS property, that property will be used to set the CRS "
"of the OGR layer. Otherwise the default will be OGC:CRS84 (WGS84 "
"longitude, latitude). As most all OGR drivers, the OAPIF driver will "
"report the SRS and geometries, and expect spatial filters, in the \"GIS-"
"friendly\" order, with longitude/easting first (X component), "
"latitude/northing second (Y component), potentially overriding the axis "
