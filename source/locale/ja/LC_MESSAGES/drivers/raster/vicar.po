"PDS3 datasets can incorporate a VICAR header. By default, GDAL will use "

"set to YES, the dataset will be opened by the VICAR driver. "
"Alternatively, starting with GDAL 3.10, specifying the ``-if VICAR`` "
"option to command line utilities accepting it, or ``VICAR`` as the only "
"value of the ``papszAllowedDrivers`` of :cpp:func:`GDALOpenEx`, also "
