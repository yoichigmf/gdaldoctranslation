"This driver provides the capability to read TerraSAR-X complex data. "
"While most users will receive products in GeoTIFF format (representing "
"detected radiation reflected from the targets, or geocoded data), ScanSAR"
" products will be distributed in COSAR format."

msgid ""
"Essentially, COSAR is an annotated binary matrix, with each sample held "
"in 4 bytes (16 bits real, 16 bits imaginary) stored with the most "
"significant byte first (Big Endian). Within a COSAR container there are "
"one or more \"bursts\" which represent individual ScanSAR bursts. Note "
"that if a Stripmap or Spotlight product is held in a COSAR container it "
"is stored in a single burst."

"Support for ScanSAR data is currently under way, due to the difficulties "
"in fitting the ScanSAR \"burst\" identifiers into the GDAL model."
