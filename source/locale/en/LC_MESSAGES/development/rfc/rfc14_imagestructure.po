"This RFC attempts to formalize the semantics of the \"IMAGE_STRUCTURE\" "
"domain of metadata. This metadata domain is used to hold structural "
"information about image organization that would not normally be carried "
"with an image when translated into another format. The IMAGE_STRUCTURE "
"metadata may occur on the GDALDataset or on individual bands, and most "
"items are meaningful in both contexts. When items like NBITS are found on"
" the dataset it is assumed they apply to all bands of that dataset."

"NBITS:: The actual number of bits used for this band, or the bands of "
