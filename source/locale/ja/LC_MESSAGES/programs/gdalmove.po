"The :program:`gdalmove.py` script transforms the bounds of a raster file "
"from one coordinate system to another, and then updates the coordinate "
"system and geotransform of the file. This is done without altering pixel "
"values at all. It is loosely similar to using gdalwarp to transform an "
"image but avoiding the resampling step in order to avoid image damage. It"
" is generally only suitable for transformations that are effectively "
"linear in the area of the file."
