"In the *data* folder of the GDAL distribution, you can find an "

"creation option of the :ref:`PG driver <vector.pg>`. The "

"Due to the nature of OSM files and how the driver works internally, the "

"Due to way .osm or .pbf files are structured and the parsing of the file "

"layer will also affect other layers. This may result in lines or polygons"
" that have missing vertices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/drivers/vector/osm.rst:186
msgid ""
"To improve this, a possibility is using a larger spatial filter with some"
" buffer for the points layer, and then post-process the output to apply "
"the desired filter. This would not work however if a polygon has vertices"
" very far away from the interest area. In which case full conversion of "
"the file to another format, and filtering of the resulting lines or "
"polygons layers would be needed."
