"When writing into transactional DBMS (SQLite/PostgreSQL,MySQL, etc...), "
"it might be beneficial to increase the number of INSERT statements "
"executed between BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements. "
"This number is specified with the -gt option. For example, for SQLite, "
"explicitly defining -gt 65536 ensures optimal performance while "
"populating some table containing many hundreds of thousands or millions "
"of rows. However, note that -skipfailures overrides -gt and sets the size"

"Starting with GDAL 3.8, ogr2ogr uses internally an Arrow array based API "
"(cf :ref:`rfc-86`) for some source formats (in particular GeoPackage or "
"FlatGeoBuf), and for the most basic types of operations, to improve "
"performance. This substantial change in the ogr2ogr internal logic has "
"required a number of fixes throughout the GDAL 3.8.x bugfix releases to "
"fully stabilize it, and we believe most issues are resolved with GDAL "
"3.9. If you hit errors not met with earlier GDAL versions, you may "
"specify ``--config OGR2OGR_USE_ARROW_API NO`` on the ogr2ogr command line"
" to opt for the classic algorithm using an iterative feature based "
"approach. If that flag is needed with GDAL >= 3.9, please file an issue "
"on the `GDAL issue tracker <https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues>`__."
