"The driver supports reading and writing: - georeferencing: encoded as a "

"Reading or writing involves ingesting the whole uncompressed image in "
"memory. Compression is in particular very memory hungry with current "
"libjxl implementation. For large images (let's say width or height larger"
" than 10,000 pixels), using JPEGXL compression as a :ref:`raster.gtiff` "
"codec is thus recommended."
