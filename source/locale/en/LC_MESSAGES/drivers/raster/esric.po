"As defined in the standard conf.xml file, the cache tile grid has an "
"origin location, stored in the **CacheInfo.TileCacheInfo.TileOrigin** "
"element, which has X and Y components. The cache size is not explicitly "
"defined. The ESRIC format driver will assume a symmetric area around the "
"0,0 coordinates, in the reference system coordinates. This is true for "
"the standard Web Mercator and GCS reference systems. If this assumption "
"is not valid, the conf.xml file can be modified, adding a non-standard "
"**CacheInfo.TileCacheInfo.TileEnd** element with the appropriate values "
"for the X and Y components, similar to the **TileOrigin**. Note that the "
"grid origin and size is different from the raster data extent. For "
"example, it is common to generate a cache in the standard Web Mercator "
"tile grid, which is defined for the whole Earth, even if data is only "
"available for a small region of the globe."

"A bundled cache has multiple resolution levels, encoded in a series of "

"nodes are identified by the **LevelID** value, which have to be "
"successive, starting with 0 for the level with the largest value for the "
"**Resolution** and increasing towards the **LODInfo** node with smallest "
"**Resolution** value. The level convention is similar to other Level, Row"
" and Column tile addressing schemes used in WMTS for example. While "
"common, it is not a requirement to have the resolutions of two successive"
" levels differ by a factor of two. Each cache level will be read as an "
"overview, at the appropriate resolution. The resolution values are in "
"spatial reference distance units per pixel."

"Many caches are built level by level from different sources, similar to "

"than an adjacent one, or content for a specific level can be missing "
"altogether. This driver will return opaque black when reading areas which"
" do not have tiles in the cache at a given resolution level, even if data"
