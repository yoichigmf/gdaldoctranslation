"Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML-based language for managing the "
"display of 3D geospatial data. KML has been accepted as an OGC standard, "
"and is supported in one way or another on the major GeoBrowsers. Note "
"that KML by specification uses only a single projection, EPSG:4326. All "
"OGR KML output will be presented in EPSG:4326. As such OGR will create "
"layers in the correct coordinate system and transform any geometries."

"Google Earth seems to have some limits regarding the number of "
"coordinates in complex geometries like polygons. If the problem appears, "
"then problematic geometries are displayed completely or partially covered"
" by vertical stripes. Unfortunately, there are no exact number given in "
"the KML specification about this limitation, so the KML driver will not "
"warn about potential problems. One of possible and tested solutions is to"
" simplify a line or a polygon to remove some coordinates. Here is the "
