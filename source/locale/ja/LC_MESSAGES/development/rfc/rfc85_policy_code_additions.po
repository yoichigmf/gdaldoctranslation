msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:17
msgid ""
"This document describes the policies that the GDAL project will apply to "
"assess substantial code additions, typically new drivers, in particular "
"coming from new contributors to the project."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:24
msgid ""
"The GDAL project has historically been quite open to new code additions, "
"including drivers that rely on proprietary licensed and/or closed-source "
"SDKs (called \"binary SDK\" in the rest of this document). This approach "
"is part of its strengths, but also comes at a price, with the software "
"becoming larger and larger, and with contributions sometimes being "
"abandoned by their authors without new maintainers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:31
msgid ""
"Being a free & open-source project, the GDAL project will apply stronger "
"scrutiny to code that requires a binary SDK and encourage contributors to"
" submit code additions that do not depend on such binary SDK, or license "
"SDKs under free & open-source license terms."

"Drivers require a designated responsible contact, tracked in "
"https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/wiki/Maintainers-per-sub-system"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:42
msgid ""
"Contributions should follow other RFCs describing development rules, and "
"come with test scripts and sufficient documentation, covering usage and "
"build instructions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:45
msgid ""
"If the driver require a binary SDK not downloadable without cost, or that"
" requires a complicated registration process, the GDAL team is unlikely "
"to support driver inclusion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:48
msgid ""
"GDAL supports multiple operating systems, and new drivers should support "
"as many as is practical. At a minimum, drivers should work with the "
"latest and OS-vendor supported releases of operating systems the driver "
"is documented to work with."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:52
msgid ""
"If the binary SDK is no longer supported, or modernized to work with "
"current compilers and GDAL, the driver can be dropped. This rule also "
"applies to open-source dependencies that are no longer maintained or are "
"superseded by other alternatives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:56
msgid ""
"If the driver has unaddressed bugs, is breaking continuous integration "
"(CI), has caused CI bits to be disabled, or has not caught up to API "
"modifications requiring updates (extremely rare), the driver will be "
"dropped from build scripts, and thus will not be built without "
"significant user intervention."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc85_policy_code_additions.rst:61
msgid ""
"If critical/blocking issues reported in a driver are not addressed within"
" a 2 month time-frame, it can be dropped from the tree entirely by a "
"designated GDAL maintainer for all releases going forward."

msgid ""
"Contributors of significant code additions are expected to participate in"
" the day-to-day life of the GDAL project, and need to monitor closely the"
" communication channels of the project: issue tracker, mailing lists, "
"etc."

msgid ""
"Maintainers are expected to support their contributions by triaging bug "
"reports, reviewing related pull requests and RFCs, making functional "
"enhancements, testing releases, and improving documentation, tests, and "
"infrastructure."

"In addition, maintainers are expected to respond in a timely manner to "
"wider project changes (CI, build scripts, upgrade of dependencies, build "
"tools, documentation, etc.) as it pertains to their contributions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"New contributions may require a significant review effort from a GDAL "
"committer (ie someone with direct modification rights to the source "
"repository). While the project has funded maintainers, it must be "
"understood that they might not be immediately available to do reviews of "
"significant code additions. Contributors may contract GDAL committers to "
"have such task done within a more predictable timeline."
