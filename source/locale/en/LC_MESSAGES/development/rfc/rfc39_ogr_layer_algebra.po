"It is proposed that the OGR layer class and the C API contains methods "
"for commonly needed overlay analysis methods."

msgid ""
"The basic functionality for spatial analysis with GDAL is provided by "
"GEOS. However, GEOS operates on geometries and typically people work with"
" geospatial data layers. Vector data layers are represented in GDAL by "
"OGRLayer objects. Thus, there is a need for spatial analaysis operations "
"that work on layers."

"Unfortunately there is no standard for spatial analysis operations API, "
"but it is possible to create a useful set by using existing software as "
"example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc39_ogr_layer_algebra.rst:29
msgid ""
"The methods are fundamentally dependent on comparison of all the features"
" of two layers. There would possibly be huge performance improvements "
"achievable with layer specific spatial indexes. This is considered out of"
" the scope of these methods and belonging to the general problem of "
"iterating features in a layer and accessing features randomly. For these "
"reasons these methods should be only considered convenience methods and "
"not replacements for analysis in relational databases for example."

"The methods are implemented by new methods in OGRLayer class "
"(ogrsf_frmts.h and ogrlayer.cpp) and new calls in the C API (ogr_api.h). "
"The Swig bindings (ogr.i) are also extended with these methods."

"In addition to the methods in the attached patch, there should be some "

"Profiling Intersection of a layer of 46288 line string features with a "
"layer of one polygon feature (~1/3 of features within and many only "
"partly within the one feature) showed that when the method layer was a "
"Shapefile, most of the time was spent in reading the feature from the "
"Shapefile. When the method layer was copied into memory, most of the time"
" (83 %) was spent in OGRLineString::getEnvelope. The 6th version of the "
"patch contains a test against a pre-computed layer envelope, which speeds"
" up the computation in this case ~30% (from 2.44 s to 1.76 in my "
"machine). Still the most of the time (82 %) is spent in "
"OGRLineString::getEnvelope."
