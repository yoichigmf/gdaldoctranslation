"The GDALDataset supports executing commands against a datasource via the "
":cpp:func:`GDALDataset::ExecuteSQL` method. How such commands are "
"evaluated is dependent on the datasets."

"For most file formats (e.g. Shapefiles, GeoJSON, MapInfo files), the "
"built-in :ref:`ogr_sql_dialect` dialect will be used by defaults. It is "
"also possible to request the :ref:`sql_sqlite_dialect` alternate dialect "
"to be used, which will use the SQLite engine to evaluate commands on GDAL"
" datasets."

"All OGR drivers for database systems: :ref:`vector.mysql`, "
":ref:`vector.pg`, :ref:`vector.oci`, :ref:`vector.sqlite`, "
":ref:`vector.gpkg`, :ref:`vector.odbc`, :ref:`vector.pgeo`, "
":ref:`vector.hana` and :ref:`vector.mssqlspatial`, override the "
":cpp:func:`GDALDataset::ExecuteSQL` function with dedicated "
"implementation and, by default, pass the SQL statements directly to the "
"underlying RDBMS. In these cases the SQL syntax varies in some "
"particulars from OGR SQL. Also, anything possible in SQL can then be "
"accomplished for these particular databases. Generally, only the result "
"of SELECT statements will be returned as layers. For those drivers, it is"
" also possible to explicitly request the ``OGRSQL`` and ``SQLITE`` "
"dialects, although performance will generally be much less as the native "
"SQL engine of those database systems."

"The ``pszDialect`` argument is in theory intended to allow for support of"

"The ``poSpatialFilter`` argument is a geometry used to select a bounding "
"rectangle for features to be returned in a manner similar to the "
":cpp:func:`OGRLayer::SetSpatialFilter` method.  It may be NULL for no "
"special spatial restriction."

"The result of an ExecuteSQL() call is usually a temporary OGRLayer "
"representing the results set from the statement.  This is the case for a "
"SELECT statement for instance.  The returned temporary layer should be "
"released with :cpp:func:`GDALDataset::ReleaseResultsSet` method when no "
"longer needed.  Failure to release it before the datasource is destroyed "
"may result in a crash."
