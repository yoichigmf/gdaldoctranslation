"OGR supports reading and writing GMT ASCII vector format. This is the "
"format used by the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) package, and includes "
"recent additions to the format to handle more geometry types, and "
"attributes. Currently GMT files are only supported if they have the "
"extension \".gmt\". Old (simple) GMT files are treated as either point, "
"or linestring files depending on whether a \">\" line is encountered "
"before the first vertex. New style files have a variety of auxiliary "
"information including geometry type, layer extents, coordinate system and"
" attribute field declarations in comments in the header, and for each "
"feature can have attributes."

"The driver supports creating new GMT files, and appending additional "
"features to existing files, but update of existing features is not "
"supported. Each layer is created as a separate .gmt file. If a name that "
"ends with .gmt is not given, then the GMT driver will take the layer name"
" and add the \".gmt\" extension."
