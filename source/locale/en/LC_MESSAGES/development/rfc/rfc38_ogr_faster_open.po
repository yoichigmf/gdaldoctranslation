"It is proposed that the OGR datasource opening mechanism relies on the "
"GDALOpenInfo class, already used by GDAL drivers, to speed-up datasource "
"opening. The speed-up is due to the fact that the file passed to "
"OGROpen() will be opened and stat'ed only once, whereas currently, it is "
"opened and closed as many times as there are OGR drivers. This should be "
"particularly beneficial for network filesystems, or when trying to open a"
" file that is not a OGR datasource at all."

"The OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open() method is updated to call pfnOpen when "

"of drivers)."
