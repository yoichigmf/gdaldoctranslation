"The RadarSat 2 XML products are distributed with a primary XML file "
"called product.xml, and a set of supporting XML data files with the "
"actual imagery stored in TIFF files. The RS2 driver will be used if the "
"product.xml or the containing directory is selected, and it can treat all"
" the imagery as one consistent dataset."

"The complex products use \"32bit void typed\" TIFF files which are not "
"meaningfully readable normally. The RS2 driver takes care of converting "
"this into useful CInt16 format internally."

"The RS2 driver also reads geolocation tiepoints from the product.xml file"

"It is very likely that RadarSat International will be distributing other "
"sorts of datasets in this format; however, at this time this driver only "
"supports specific RadarSat 2 polarimetric products. All other will be "
"ignored, or result in various runtime errors. It is hoped that this "
"driver can be generalized when other product samples become available."
