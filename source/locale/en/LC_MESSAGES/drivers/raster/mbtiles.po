"Technical/implementation note: in the general case, GDAL blocks do not "
"exactly match a single MBTiles tile. In which case, each GDAL block will "
"overlap four MBTiles tiles. This is easily handled on the read side, but "
"on creation/update side, such configuration could cause numerous "
"decompression/ recompression of tiles to be done, which might cause "
"unnecessary quality loss when using lossy compression (JPEG). To avoid "
"that, the driver will create a temporary database next to the main "
"MBTiles file to store partial MBTiles tiles in a lossless (and "
"uncompressed) way. Once a tile has received data for its four quadrants "
"and for all the bands (or the dataset is closed or explicitly flushed "
"with FlushCache()), those uncompressed tiles are definitely transferred "
"to the MBTiles file with the appropriate compression. All of this is "

"PNG8 can be selected to use 8-bit PNG with a color table up to 256 "

"The DITHER option can be set to YES to use Floyd/Steinberg dithering "
"algorithm, which spreads the quantization error on neighbouring pixels "
"for better rendering (note however than when zooming in, this can cause "
"non desirable visual artifacts). Setting it to YES will generally cause "
"less effective compression. Note that at that time, such an 8-bit PNG "
"formulation is only used for fully opaque tiles, as the median-cut "
"algorithm currently implemented to compute the optimal color table does "
"not support alpha channel (even if PNG8 format would potentially allow "
"color table with transparency). So when selecting PNG8, non fully opaque "
