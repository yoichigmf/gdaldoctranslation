"The :program:`gdaldem` generally assumes that x, y and z units are "
"identical. If x (east-west) and y (north-south) units are identical, but "
"z (elevation) units are different, the scale (-s) option can be used to "
"set the ratio of vertical units to horizontal. For LatLong projections "
"near the equator, where units of latitude and units of longitude are "
"similar, elevation (z) units can be converted to be compatible by using "
"scale=370400 (if elevation is in feet) or scale=111120 (if elevation is "
"in meters).  For locations not near the equator, it would be best to "
