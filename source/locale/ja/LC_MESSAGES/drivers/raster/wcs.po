"Accessing a WCS server is accomplished by creating a local service "
"description file that contains one `<WCS_GDAL>` XML element. It is "
"important that there is no spaces or other content outside that element. "
"Starting at version 2.3 the service description file is meant to be "
"managed by the driver in a cache directory. User should control the "
"contents of the service file using options. The dataset name is "
":samp:`WCS:<URL>`, where the <URL> is the URL of the server appended "
"potentially appended with WCS version, coverage, and possibly other "
"parameters. If the WCS version is 2.0.1 further parameters can be given "
"to control how the data model of the coverage is mapped to the GDAL data "
"model."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the URL does not contain a coverage name, the driver attempts to fetch"
" the capabilities document from the server, parse it, and show the "
"resulting metadata to the user. Coverages are shown as subdatasets. If "
"the URL contains a coverage name as parameter (the key 'coverage' can be "
"used irrespective of the WCS version), the driver attempts to fetch the "
"coverage description document from the server, parse it, and create "
"service description file. A small test GetCoverage request may be done to"
" obtain details of the served data. If the respective server capabilities"
" file is not cached, it will also be fetched."

"With service version 2.0.1 (for which support is available starting at "

"version 2.0.1 is available starting at GDAL 2.3). Any return format that "
