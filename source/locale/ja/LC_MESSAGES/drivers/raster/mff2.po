"GDAL supports MFF2 Image raster file format for read, update, and "
"creation. The MFF2 (Multi-File Format 2) format was designed to fit into "
"Vexcel Hierarchical Key-Value (HKV) databases, which can store binary "
"data as well as ASCII parameters. This format is primarily used "
"internally to the Vexcel InSAR processing system."

"Newly created files (with a type of ``MFF2``) are always just raw rasters"

"IMPORTANT: When creating a new MFF2, be sure to set the projection before"

"An MFF2 \"file\" is actually a set of files stored in a directory "

"\"georef\" file containing georeferencing and projection information, and"
" an \"image_data_ovr\" (for \"image_data\" binary image data) file "
"containing tiled overviews of the image in TIFF format. The ASCII files "
