"GDAL has limited support for reading NLAPS Data Format files. This is a "
"format primarily used by the Eros Data Center for distribution of Landsat"
" data. NDF datasets consist of a header file (often with the extension "
".H1) and one or more associated raw data files (often .I1, .I2, ...). To "
"open a dataset select the header file, often with the extension .H1, .H2 "
"or .HD."
