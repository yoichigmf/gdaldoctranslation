"This utility will scan an image and try to set all pixels that are nearly"
" or exactly black, white or one or more custom colors around the collar "
"to black or white. This is often used to \"fix up\" lossy compressed air "
"photos so that color pixels can be treated as transparent when mosaicing."
" The output format must use lossless compression if either alpha band or "
"mask band is not set."

"  A scan \"in\" is done from either end setting pixels to black or white "

"gray levels away from black, white or custom colors have been encountered"
