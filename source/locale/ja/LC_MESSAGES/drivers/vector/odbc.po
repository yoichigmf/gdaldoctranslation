"OGR optionally supports spatial and non-spatial tables accessed via ODBC."
" ODBC is a generic access layer for access to many database systems, and "
"data that can be represented as a database (collection of tables). ODBC "
"support is potentially available on Unix and Windows platforms, but is "
"only included in unix builds by special configuration options."

"The **dsn** is the ODBC Data Source Name. Normally ODBC datasources are "

"By default the ODBC searches for GEOMETRY_COLUMNS table. If found it is "
"used to identify the set of spatial tables that should be treated as "
"layers by OGR. If not found, then all tables in the datasource are "
"returned as non-spatial layers. However, if a table list (a list of comma"
" separated table names) is provided, then only those tables will be "
"represented as layers (non-spatial). Fetching the full definition of all "
"tables in a complicated database can be quite time consuming, so the "
"ability to restrict the set of tables accessed is primarily a performance"
" issue."

"If the GEOMETRY_COLUMNS table is found, it is used to select a column to "
"be the geometry source. If the tables are passed in the datasource name, "
"then the geometry column associated with a table can be included in round"
" brackets after the tablename. It is currently a hardcoded assumption "
"that the geometry is in Well Known Binary (WKB) format if the field is "
"binary, or Well Known Text (WKT) otherwise. The GEOMETRY_COLUMNS table "
"should have at least the columns F_TABLE_NAME, F_GEOMETRY_COLUMN and "
"GEOMETRY_TYPE."

"If the table has a geometry column, and has fields called XMIN, YMIN, "
"XMAX and YMAX then direct table queries with a spatial filter accelerate "

"the extent of the geometry in the row in the tables coordinate system."
