"Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be used "
"to control particulars about the file created. For instance, the GeoTIFF "
"driver supports creation options to control compression, and whether the "
"file should be tiled."

"The creation options available vary by format driver, and some simple "
"formats have no creation options at all. A list of options supported for "
"a format can be listed with the :ref:`--formats "
"<raster_common_options_formats>` command line option but the "
"documentation for the format is the definitive source of information on "
"driver creation options. See :ref:`raster_drivers` format specific "
"documentation for legal creation options for each format."
