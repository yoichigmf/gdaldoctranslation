"Therefore the presence or absence of the Idrisi software in the running "
"operation system will determine the way that this driver will work. By "
"setting the environment variable IDRISIDIR pointing to the Idrisi main "
"installation folder will enable GDAL to find more detailed information "

"Note that the driver recognizes the name convention used in Idrisi for "
"UTM and State Plane geographic reference so it doesn't need to access the"
" REF files. That is the case for RDC file that specify \"utm-30n\" or "
"\"spc87ma1\" in the \"ref. system\" field. Note that exporting to RST in "
"any other geographical reference system will generate a suggested REF "
"content in the comment section of the RDC file."
