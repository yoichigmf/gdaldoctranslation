"The order in which drivers are listed is the one in which they are "
"registered, which determines the order in which they are successively "
"probed when opening a dataset. Most of the time, this order does not "
"matter, but in some situations, several drivers may recognize the same "
"file. The ``-if`` option of some utilities can be specified to restrict "
"opening the dataset with a subset of drivers (generally one). Note that "
"it does not force those drivers to open the dataset. In particular, some "
"drivers have requirements on file extensions. Alternatively, the "
":config:`GDAL_SKIP` configuration option can also be used to exclude one "
"or several drivers."
