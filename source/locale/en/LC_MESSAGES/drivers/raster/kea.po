"KEA is an image file format, named after the New Zealand bird, that "
"provides a full implementation of the GDAL data model and is implemented "
"within a HDF5 file. A software library, libkea, is used to access the "
"file format. The format has comparable performance with existing formats "
"while producing smaller file sizes and is already within active use for a"
" number of projects within Landcare Research, New Zealand, and the wider "
"community."
