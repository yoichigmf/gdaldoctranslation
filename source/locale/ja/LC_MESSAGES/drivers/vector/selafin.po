"OGR supports reading from 2D Selafin/Seraphin files. Selafin/Seraphin is "
"the generic output and input format of geographical files in the open-"
"source `Telemac hydraulic model <http://www.opentelemac.org>`__. The file"
" format is suited to the description of numerical attributes for a set of"
" point features at different time steps. Those features usually "
"correspond to the nodes in a finite-element model. The file also holds a "
"connectivity table which describes the elements formed by those nodes and"

"The driver offers full read-write support on Selafin files. However, due "
"to the particular nature of Selafin files where element (polygon) "
"features and node (point) features are closely related, writing on "
"Selafin layers can lead to counter-intuitive results. In a general way, "
"writing on any layer of a Selafin data-source will cause side effects on "
"all the other layers. Also, it is very important **not to open the same "
"datasource more than once in update mode**. Having two processes write at"
" the same time on a single datasource can lead to irreversible data "
"corruption. The driver issues a warning each time a datasource is opened "
"in update mode."
