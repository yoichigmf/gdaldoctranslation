"GDAL supports some variations of raw raster files with associated ENVI "
"style .hdr files describing the format. To select an existing ENVI raster"
" file select the binary file containing the data (as opposed to the .hdr "
"file), and GDAL will find the .hdr file by replacing the dataset "
"extension with .hdr."

"GDAL should support reading bil, bip and bsq interleaved formats, and "
"most pixel types are supported, including 8bit unsigned, 16 and 32bit "
"signed and unsigned integers, 32bit and 64 bit floating point, and 32bit "
"and 64bit complex floating point. There is limited support for "
"recognising map_info keywords with the coordinate system and "
"georeferencing. In particular, UTM and State Plane should work."
