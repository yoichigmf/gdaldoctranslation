"This program builds a VRT (Virtual Dataset) that is a mosaic of the list "
"of input GDAL datasets. The list of input GDAL datasets can be specified "
"at the end of the command line, or put in a text file (one filename per "
"line) for very long lists, or it can be a MapServer tileindex (see "
":ref:`gdaltindex` utility). In the later case, all entries in the tile "
"index will be added to the VRT."

"Starting with GDAL 3.9, for virtual mosaic with a very large number of "

"priority datasets, but currently, alpha channel is not taken into account"
" to do alpha compositing (so a source with alpha=0 appearing on top of "
