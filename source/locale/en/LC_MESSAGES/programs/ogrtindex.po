":program:`ogrtindex` program can be used to create a tileindex - a file "
"containing a list of the identities of a bunch of other files along with "
"their spatial extents. This is primarily intended to be used with "
"`MapServer <http://mapserver.org/>`__ for tiled access to layers using "
"the OGR connection type."
