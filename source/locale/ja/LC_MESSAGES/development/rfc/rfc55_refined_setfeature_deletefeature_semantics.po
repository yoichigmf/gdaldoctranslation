msgid ""
"This RFC refines the semantics of SetFeature() and DeleteFeature() so as "
"to be able to distinguish nominal case, attempts of updating/deleting "
"non-existing features, from failures to update/delete existing features."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc55_refined_setfeature_deletefeature_semantics.rst:23
msgid ""
"Currently, depending on the drivers, calling SetFeature() or "
"DeleteFeature() on a non-existing feature may succeed, or fail. It is "
"generally not desirable that those functions return the OGRERR_NONE code,"
" as in most situations, it might be a sign of invalid input. Therefore "
"the OGRERR_NON_EXISTING_FEATURE return code is introduced so that drivers"
" can inform the calling code that it has attempted to update or delete a "
"non-existing feature."

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc55_refined_setfeature_deletefeature_semantics.rst:47
msgid ""
"The behavior of the shapefile driver is a bit particular, in that, its "
"SetFeature() implementation accepts to recreate a feature that had been "
"deleted (and its CreateFeature() implementation ignores any set FID on "
"the passed feature to append a new feature). So "
"OGRERR_NON_EXISTING_FEATURE will effictively been returned only if the "
"FID is negative or greater or equal to the maximum feature count."
