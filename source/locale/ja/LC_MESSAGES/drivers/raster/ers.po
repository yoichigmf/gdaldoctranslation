"GDAL supports reading and writing raster files with .ers header files, "
"with some limitations. The .ers ascii format is used by ERMapper for "
"labeling raw data files, as well as for providing extended metadata, and "
"georeferencing for some other file formats. The .ERS format, or variants "
"are also used to hold descriptions of ERMapper algorithms, but these are "
"not supported by GDAL."
