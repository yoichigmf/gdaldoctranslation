"File or Random Access format, also known as Feather: for serializing a "
"fixed number of record batches. Random access is required to read such "
"files, but they can be generated using a streaming-only capable file. The"
" recommended extension for such file is ``.arrow``"

"Streaming IPC format: for sending an arbitrary length sequence of record "
"batches. The format must generally be processed from start to end, and "
"does not require random access. That format is not generally materialized"
" as a file. If it is, the recommended extension is ``.arrows`` (with a "
"trailing s). But the driver can support regular files as well as the "
"/vsistdin/ and /vsistdout/ streaming files. On opening, it might "
"difficult for the driver to detect that the content is specifically a "
"Arrow IPC stream, especially if the extension is not ``.arrows``, and the"
" metadata section is large. Prefixing the filename with "
"``ARROW_IPC_STREAM:`` (e.g \"ARROW_IPC_STREAM:/vsistdin/\") will cause "
"the driver to unconditionally open the file as a streaming IPC format. "
"Alternatively, starting with GDAL 3.10, specifying the ``-if ARROW`` "
"option to command line utilities accepting it, or ``ARROW`` as the only "
"value of the ``papszAllowedDrivers`` of :cpp:func:`GDALOpenEx`, also "
"forces the driver to recognize the passed filename."
