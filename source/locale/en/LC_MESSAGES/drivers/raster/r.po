"The R Object File Format is supported for write access, and limited read "
"access by GDAL. This format is the native format R uses for objects saved"
" with the *save* command and loaded with the *load* command. GDAL "
"supports writing a dataset as an array object in this format, and "
"supports reading files with simple rasters in essentially the same "
"organization. It will not read most R object files."
