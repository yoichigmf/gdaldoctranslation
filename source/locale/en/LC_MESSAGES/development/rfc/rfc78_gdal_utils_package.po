"This RFC suggests to put all the GDAL python modules (formly scripts), "

"The straightforward way of cloning `gdal` and adding `gdal/swig/python` "
"to Python path (In PyCharm: marking the it as a `Source Root`) won't work"
" because the `pyc` files are missing from `gdal/swig/python/osgeo`, thus "
"by adding `osgeo` to Python path we would be masking a binary "
"installation of gdal that might be already installed (i.e. `osgeo4w` or "
"Christoph Gohlke's binary Windows wheels). Workarounds, like copying the "
"`pyc` files to the `osgeo` dir, cause their own problems, like: * "
"Switching interpreters that have different versions of `gdal` causes more"
" problems. * Non clean git working tree so committing the changes to git "
"is harder. By moving the `gdal-utils` into another root this problem is "
"completely avoid."
