"Format/driver name to be attempted to open the input file(s). It is "
"generally not necessary to specify it, but it can be used to skip "
"automatic driver detection, when it fails to select the appropriate "
"driver. This option can be repeated several times to specify several "
"candidate drivers. Note that it does not force those drivers to open the "
"dataset. In particular, some drivers have requirements on file "
"extensions."
