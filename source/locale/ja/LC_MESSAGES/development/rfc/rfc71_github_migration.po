"It is proposed that the GDAL source tree and ticket database moves from "
"the OSGeo hosted Subversion repository/Trac database to GitHub. Full "
"source code history will be preserved. To make the migration simpler, "
"existing tickets will remain in OSGeo Trac and will not be migrated to "
"GitHub. New tickets will have to be opened in GitHub."

"It is considered that most developers interested by GDAL development are "

"The `https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal <https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal>`__ "
"mirror has existed since 2012 and has over time become the preferred way "
"for contributors without direct SVN access (or even those with SVN "
"access) to submit their contributions, in particular because of the "
"coupling with the continuous integratations services of Travis-CI and "
"!AppVeyor that enable maintainers to check that the contribution doesn't "
"introduce known regressions + the friendly way of commenting a pull "
"request. However the manual porting of !GitHub pull requests to Trac is a"
" bit painful for GDAL maintainers."
