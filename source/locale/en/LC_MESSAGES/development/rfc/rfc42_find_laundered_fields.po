msgid ""
"This (mini)RFC proposes a new method in the OGR layer class (and a C API)"
" to lookup the field index of fields, whose names have been altered by "
"drivers (eg. by LAUNDER in OCI or Pg)."

msgid ""
"There is already a pull request on github "
"(`https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/23 "
"<https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/23>`__) that implements this RFC. It "
"adds the virtual method OGRLayer::FindFieldIndex(), that implements the "
"usual mapping, which can be overloaded by drivers. The OCI driver does "
"this to optionally return the index of the LAUNDERed field in case the "
"original field does not exists. The pull request also modifies ogr2ogr to"
" make use of that method and offers a switch -relaxedFieldNameMatch to "
"enable it."

msgid ""
"This is a particular problem when using NAS as that usually operates on a"
" pre-existing schema. This schema had to be adapted for Oracle as Oracle "
"has a identifier length restrictions that quite a number of identifiers "
"in NAS exceed. Hence ogr2ogr failed to make the mapping between the short"
" names and their long counter parts and leaves those fields empty."
