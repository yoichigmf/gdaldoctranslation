"This document proposes a mechanism for application to indicate a desire "
"for the fastest possible open of a raster file, even if a variety of "
"metadata and supporting information may not be available. It is primarily"
" intended to optimize applications working with catalogs containing many "
"raster files."

"An application can request fast open mode by setting the "
"\"GDAL_FAST_OPEN\" configuration option to \"YES\" - the default is "
"assumed to be no. When this option is set to YES selected drivers can "
"operate differently so as to optimize the speed of opening a dataset. "
"Acceleration options include:"

"It is anticipated that fast open mode will be used primarily for fast "
"raster display from datasets where required metadata is already provided "
"by a catalog of some sort. Because of this it is essential that in fast "
"open mode datasets will still accurately return a list of bands, their "
"datatypes, and their overviews."

"In multi-threaded applications use of a process-global configuration "
"option - turned on just while calling GDALOpen() - may not be "
"appropriate. In particular, it is hard to ensure that this configuration "
"option won't affect GDALOpen()'s in other threads of the same process. "
"This problem also affects other configuration options that. To resolve "
"this problem it is intended to add a new function to set \"thread local\""
" configuration options."

"In theory, it would also be desirable for MapServer to utilize this mode "
