"This proposal is to add syntaxic sugar to make GDAL and OGR command line "
"utilities, so they take into account the extension of the output filename"
" to guess which output driver to use, when it is not explicitly specified"
" with -f / -of switch."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Currently command line utilities require to explicitly specify the output"
" format when not wishing to use the default format (generally GeoTIFF for"
" raster, and Shapefile for vector). But this is rather counter-intuitive."
" For example \"gdal_translate in.tif out.png\" will generate a GeoTIFF, "
"and \"ogr2ogr out.gpkg in.shp\" a shapefile. So you have to specify "
"respectively -of PNG and -f GPKG to get the expected result."
msgstr ""

"Guessing the output format from the extension of the output filename is "
"for example a behavior found in ImageMagick convert utility, or in "
"OpenJPEG opj_compress/opj_decompress utilities."

"Command line utilities, when neither -f nor -of are specified (note: "
"since r39878 both switches can be indifferently used), will loop through "
"the registered drivers and check if one or several drivers, with output "
"capabilities, declare to recognize the extension of the output filename."

"When one and only one driver declares this extension (.tif, .png, .jpg "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc70_output_format_guess.rst:48
msgid ""
"When several drivers declare this extension (for example KML and LIBKML "
"for .kml), the utility will select the first registered driver (except "
"netCDF instead of GMT for .nc files), and a warning is emitted specifying"
" which driver is used"

"Since at least GDAL 1.10, the base of this logic already exists since a "

"format is known to be recognized by another driver than the default "
"output driver."

"Similarly, for vector output, if doing something like \"ogr2ogr "
"PG:dbname=mydb out.shp\", a PG:dbname=mydb directory is created with "
"shapefiles, instead of ingesting the shapefile into PostgreSQL. A warning"
" is emitted in that case since the PG driver declares the PG: prefix in "
"its metadata. The new behavior will be to imply the -update switch in "
"such situation."

"There might be some fragility with the new logic in the situation where a"
" GDAL version has only one driver that supports extension xxx, but a "
"later version adds another driver that also supports extension xxx (or "
"another distribution of the same version has a plugin that handles xxx). "
"So scripts that did \"gdal_translate in out.xxx\" would now error out in "

"This will break scripts that use an output filename whose extension is "

" rather unlikely since previous GDAL versions already emit a warning in "
"this situation (for C/C++ utilities only. for Python utilities default "
"driver is silently used), so people have likely specified the output "
