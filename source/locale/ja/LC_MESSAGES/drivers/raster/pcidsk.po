"PCIDSK database file used by PCI EASI/PACE software for image analysis. "
"It is supported for reading, and writing by GDAL. All pixel data types, "
"and data organizations (pixel interleaved, band interleaved, file "
"interleaved and tiled) should be supported. Currently LUT segments are "
"ignored, but PCT segments should be treated as associated with the bands."
" Overall file, and band specific metadata should be correctly associated "
"with the image or bands."
