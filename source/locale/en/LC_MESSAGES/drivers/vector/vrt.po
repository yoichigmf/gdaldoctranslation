"OGR Virtual Format is a driver that transforms features read from other "

"different datasources into a single data source, or even just to provide "

"When the *GeometryField* is \"WKT\" spatial filtering is applied after "
"extracting all rows from the source datasource. Essentially that means "
"there is no fast spatial filtering on WKT derived geometries."

"When the *GeometryField* is \"PointFromColumns\", and a *SrcLayer* (as "
"opposed to *SrcSQL*) is used, and a spatial filter is in effect on the "
"virtual layer then the spatial filter will be internally translated into "
"an attribute filter on the X and Y columns in the *SrcLayer*. In cases "
"where fast spatial filtering is important it can be helpful to index the "
"X and Y columns in the source datastore, if that is possible. For "
"instance if the source is an RDBMS. You can turn off that feature by "
"setting the *useSpatialSubquery* attribute of the GeometryField element "
"to FALSE."
