"This utility will automatically mosaic a set of images.  All the images "
"must be in the same coordinate system and have a matching number of "
"bands, but they may be overlapping, and at different resolutions. In "
"areas of overlap, the last image will be copied over earlier ones. "
"Nodata/transparency values are considered on a band by band level, i.e. a"
" nodata/transparent pixel on one source band will not set a "
"nodata/transparent value on all bands for the target pixel in the "
"resulting raster nor will it overwrite a valid pixel value."
