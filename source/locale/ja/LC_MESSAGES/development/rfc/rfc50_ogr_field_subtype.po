"This RFC aims at adding the capability of specifying sub-types to OGR "
"fields, like boolean, 16 bit integers or 32 bit floating point values. "
"The sub-type of a field definition is an additional attribute that "
"specifies a hint or a restriction to the main type. The subtype can be "
"used by applications and drivers that know how to handle it, and can "
"generally be safely ignored by applications and drivers that do not."
