"High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is a container format for "
"individual images and image sequences. The driver has mostly been "
"developed and tested to be able to read images using the High Efficiency "
"Video Coding (HEVC, ITU-T H.265) codec. Such images are usually called "
"HEIC (HEVC in HEIF) files, and have the .heic extension. iOS 11 can "
"generate such files."
