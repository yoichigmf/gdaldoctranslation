"MrSID is a wavelet-based image compression technology which can utilize "
"both lossy and lossless encoding. This technology was acquired in its "
"original form from Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), where it was "
"developed under the aegis of the U.S. government for storing fingerprints"
" for the FBI. Now it is developed and distributed by Extensis."

"This driver supports reading of MrSID image files using Extensis' "
"decoding software development kit (DSDK). **This DSDK is not free "
"software, you should contact Extensis to obtain it (see link at end of "
"this page).** If you are using GCC, please, ensure that you have the same"
" compiler as was used for DSDK compilation. It is C++ library, so you may"
" get incompatibilities in C++ name mangling between different GCC "
"versions (2.95.x and 3.x)."

"Latest versions of the DSDK also support decoding JPEG2000 file format, "
"so this driver can be used for JPEG2000 too."

"MrSID metadata transparently translated into GDAL metadata strings. Files"
" in MrSID format contain a set of standard metadata tags such as: "
"IMAGE__WIDTH (contains the width of the image), IMAGE__HEIGHT (contains "
"the height of the image), IMAGE__XY_ORIGIN (contains the x and y "
"coordinates of the origin), IMAGE__INPUT_NAME (contains the name or names"
" of the files used to create the MrSID image) etc. GDAL's metadata keys "
"cannot contain characters \\`:' and \\`=', but standard MrSID tags always"
" contain double colons in tag names. These characters replaced in GDAL "
"with \\`_' during translation. So if you are using other software to work"
" with MrSID be ready that names of metadata keys will be shown "
"differently in GDAL."

msgid ""
"MrSID images may contain georeference and coordinate system information "
"in form of GeoTIFF GeoKeys, translated in metadata records. All those "
"GeoKeys properly extracted and used by the driver. Unfortunately, there "
"is one caveat: old MrSID encoders has a bug which resulted in wrong "
"GeoKeys, stored in MrSID files. This bug was fixed in MrSID software "
"version 1.5, but if you have older encoders or files, created with older "
"encoders, you cannot use georeference information from them."
