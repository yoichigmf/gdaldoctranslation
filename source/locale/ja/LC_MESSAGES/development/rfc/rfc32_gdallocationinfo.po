"Many users have requested a tool to find the value of a location, often "

"The gdallocationinfo utility is intended to address both sorts of "

"The pixel values and location transformation logic is all built into "

"For our immediate needs the requirement is to have the "
"VRTSourcedRasterBand return information on the file(s) overlapping the "

"sorts of information about a location. For instance, a WMS driver might "
"issue a GetFeatureInfo for the location and return the result."

"The mechanism to query the datasource is a specially named "
