msgid ""
"GDAL bindings for Python have historically dodged the normal Python "
"practices of using packages and namespaces to provide organization."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc17_python_namespaces.rst:25
msgid ""
"This RFC implements a new namespace for Python, called *osgeo*, where the"
" GDAL Python bindings henceforth will reside. Backward compatibility is "
"provided, so that current code will continue to run unchanged, but new "
"developments should utilize the namespace for code organization and "
"global namespace pollution reasons. As of 10/1/2007, the changes "
"described here in RFC 17 only pertain to the \"next-gen\" Python "
"bindings. It is expected that these bindings will be the default bindings"
" for GDAL 1.5."
