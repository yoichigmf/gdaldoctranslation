"This document proposes changes in the GDAL GTiff (GeoTIFF) driver's "
"interpretation of PixelIsPoint when constructing the geotransform and "
"interpreting control points. An RFC is used due to the fundamental role "
"of GeoTIFF in GDAL and the GDAL user community and the risk for "
"significant backward compatibility problems with this adjustment."

msgid ""
"The GeoTIFF specification includes a data item, GTRasterTypeGeoKey, which"
" may be set to either RasterPixelIsArea (the default), or "
"RasterPixelIsPoint. RasterPixelIsArea defines that a pixel represents an "
"area in the real world, while RasterPixelIsPoint defines a pixel to "
"represent a point in the real world. Often this is useful to distinguish "
"the behavior of optical sensors that average light values over an area "
"vs. raster data which is point oriented like an elevation sample at a "
"point."

"Traditionally GDAL has treated this flag as having no relevance to the "
"georeferencing of the image despite disputes from a variety of other "
"software developers and data producers. This was based on the authors "
"interpretation of something said once by the GeoTIFF author. However, a "
"recent review of section [`section 2.5.2.2 "
"<http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/spec/geotiff2.5.html#2.5.2.2>`__] "
"of the GeoTIFF specificaiton has made it clear that GDAL behavior is "
"incorrect and that PixelIsPoint georeferencing needs to be offset by a "
"half a pixel when transformed to the GDAL georeferencing model. This "
"issue is documented in the following tickets including #3837, #3838, ...."

"Interpretation of the raster space from the GeoTIFF tie points will be "

"This change will alter the apparent georeferencing of all GeoTIFF files "
"with PixelIsPoint set. It is not clear how large a proportion of GeoTIFF "
"files this will apply to, but it is significant. This isn't too bad for "
"files coming from non-GDAL sources as most other produces have made the "
"correct interpretation of PixelIsPoint for years. However, unfortunately,"
" files produced in the past by GDAL with PixelIsPoint will now be "
"interpreted differently and the values will be off by half a pixel."

"In practice it was not particularly convenient or well documented how to "

" PixelIsPoint GeoTIFF file in which the error on write just undid the "
"error when reading the source GeoTIFF file."

"Folks have at various points in the past requested that we report the "

"the GCPs, RPCs and GeoTransform will always be based on an area "
"interpretation of pixels. The AREA_OR_POINT will *only* be used to "
