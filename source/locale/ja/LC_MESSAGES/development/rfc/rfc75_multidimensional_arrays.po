msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc75_multidimensional_arrays.rst:24
msgid ""
"Multidimensional arrays (also known as hypercubes) are a way of mÐ¾delling"
" spatio-temporal (time series of 2D raster) or spatio-vertical-temporal "
"(2D + Z dimension + time dimension) data which are becoming increasingly "
"more available. GDAL current raster model is however strongly 2D "
"oriented. A number of drivers, such as netCDF, HDF4, HDF5, work around "
"that limitation by using raster bands or subdatasets to expose muliple 2D"
" slices of what is intrinsically a N>2 Multidimensional dataset. It is "
"desirable to have a proper API, and driver support, to be able to expose "
"those multidimensional arrays as such, and be able to perform slice and "
"trim operations on them."

msgid ""
"A lot of existing GDAL raster API are strongly 2D oriented. Rather than "
"upgrading all those API, and driver code, to be ready for N arbitrary "
"dimensions, which would be a enormous effort for the benefit of only a "
"small fraction of drivers, we propose to add a new dedicated API to "
"support multidimensional arrays. We also want to support hierarchical "
"structure of data as found in the `HDF5 format and data model "
"<https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/81716>`_. This model can "
"encompass the needs of other formats/drivers that have multidimensional "
"capabilities such as HDF4, netCDF, GRIB, WCS. Therefore the proposed API "
"will be strongly inspired by the API of the HDF5 library itself."
