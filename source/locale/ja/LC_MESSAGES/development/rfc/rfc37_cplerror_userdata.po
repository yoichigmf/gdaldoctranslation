"Description: This RFC proposes to implement user context data in "
"CPLErrorHandler callback functions. It does so without disrupting "
"existing callback patterns already in use, and provides completely "
"auxiliary functionality to CPLErrorHandler."

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc37_cplerror_userdata.rst:23
msgid ""
"It could be argued that users could already manage user context of error "
"handling functions with application-level globals that control its "
"interaction. While this sentiment is technically true, this approach adds"
" a ton of complication for library users. A scenario that has error "
"callbacks pass back user context data means simpler code for users "
"wishing to have the state of their application be returned along with "
"errors from inside of GDAL."

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc37_cplerror_userdata.rst:32

"It is a common idiom for signal-based APIs (of which CPLErrorHandler is "
"one)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc37_cplerror_userdata.rst:33

"It is simpler than requiring library users to manage the state of "
"internal library error handling externally in their own applications"

"GDAL's (and OGR and OSR's) error handling callback mechanisms are in wide"
" use and changes to the base library that were to break either the "
"callback signatures *or* the behavior of existing callback operations "
"should be rejected. Adding support for user data in the call back is to "
"be provided in addition to existing functionality that already exists in "
"the error handling, and an approach that mimics and looks similar to the "
"existing operations is likely the best approach for GDAL -- if not the "
"cleanest approach in general."
