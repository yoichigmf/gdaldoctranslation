"Gridding is a process of creating a regular grid (or call it a raster "
"image) from the scattered data. Typically you have a set of arbitrary "
"data scattered over the region of survey measurements and you would like "
"to convert them into the regular grid for further processing and "
"combining with other grids."

"This problem can be solved using data interpolation or approximation "
"algorithms. But you are not limited by interpolation here. Sometimes you "
"don't need to interpolate your data but rather compute some statistics or"
" data metrics over the region. Statistics are valuable themselves or "
"could be used for better choosing the interpolation algorithm and "
"parameters."
