"ogrinfo and gdalinfo are incredibly useful metadata gathering tools. "
"Their native text-based output formats, however, are not easily parseable"
" by common external tools. Both XML and JSON are easily parsed and adding"
" those output formats would substantially increase the utility for those "
"looking to add the ogrinfo and gdalinfo utilities to a scripting stack."

"To add the XML output to each utility will require \"breaking up\" the "
"main loop into contingent chunks. All diagnostic messages will also need "
"to be moved to STDERR to ensure that output on STDOUT is always "
"parseable. The XML representation will be constructed using the MiniXML "
"library built into GDAL."
