"This read-only GDAL driver is designed to provide access to processed "
"data from Sandia National Laboratories' various experimental sensors. The"
" format is essentially an arbitrary length header containing instrument "
"configuration and performance parameters along with a binary matrix of "
"16- or 32-bit complex or byte real data."

"The GFF format was implemented based on the Matlab code provided by "
"Sandia to read the data. The driver supports all types of data (16-bit or"
" 32-bit complex, real bytes) theoretically, however due to a lack of data"
" only 32-bit complex data has been tested."
