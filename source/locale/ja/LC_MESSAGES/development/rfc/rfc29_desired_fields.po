"To improve performance when fetching features, this RFC proposes a way "
"how to tell OGR which fields are not going to be required in subsequent "
"GetFeature() / GetNextFeature() calls. Such fields will be ignored by the"
" driver and their value will be kept null. The RFC counts also with the "
"possibility to ignore feature geometry and style."
