"It is proposed that OGRSFDriver::Open() and OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open() "
"calls should be changed to accept additional parameter containing "
"arbitrary additional parameters supplied by caller. OGROpenEx() function "
"will be introduced to map this new functionality into C interface. In "
"addition it is proposed to add an \"update\" flag to "
"OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open() call to avoid using "
"OGRSFDriverRegistrar::OpenShared() method."

"Sometimes it is needed to pass additional information to OGR driver along"
" with the name of the dataset to be opened. It can be, for example, the "
"style table name (some drivers allow to choose from the various style "
"tables) or any other additional data. The old method for doing this was "
"to encode the extra info in the dataset name string. It was inconvenient "
"approach, so it proposed to use separate parameter in OGRSFDriver::Open()"
" and OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open() calls representing open options, just "
"like it is implemented in OGRDataSource::CreateLayer() call."
