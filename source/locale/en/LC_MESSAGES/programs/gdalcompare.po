"Image pixels, and various metadata are checked. There is also a byte by "

" important that the GDAL visible data is identical a difference count of "

"Note that the :program:`gdalcompare.py` script (like all the other "
"scripts) can also be called as a library from python code: `from "
"osgeo_utils import gdalcompare`. The primary entry point is "
"`gdalcompare.compare_db()` which takes a golden `gdal.Dataset` and a new "
"`gdal.Dataset` as arguments and returns a difference count (excluding the"
" binary comparison). The `gdalcompare.compare_sds()` entry point can be "
"used to compare subdatasets."
