"Supported by GDAL for read access. This format is the internal binary "
"format for Arc/Info Grid, and takes the form of a coverage level "
"directory in an Arc/Info database. To open the coverage select the "
"coverage directory, or an .adf file (such as hdr.adf) from within it. If "
"the directory does not contain file(s) with names like w001001.adf then "
"it is not a grid coverage."
