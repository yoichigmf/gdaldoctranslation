"The configuration option **NAS_GFS_TEMPLATE** makes it possible to "
"cleanly map element paths to feature attributes using a GFS file like in "
"the GML driver. Multiple geometries per layer are also possible (eg. "
"ax_flurstueck.objektkoordinaten next to the regular wkb_geometry). "
"Starting with GDAL 3.7, defining the NAS_GFS_TEMPLATE configuration "
"option is required for the NAS driver to open a file. It may be set to "
"the empty string to mean that the driver should try to establish the "
"schema of the file from its content, but using one of templates mentioned"
" below is recommended."
