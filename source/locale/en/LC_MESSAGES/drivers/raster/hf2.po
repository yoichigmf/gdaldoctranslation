"HF2 is a heightfield format that records difference between consecutive "
"cell values. HF2 files can also optionally be compressed by the gzip "
"algorithm, and so the HF2.GZ files (or HFZ, equivalently) may be "
"significantly smaller than the uncompressed data. The file format enables"
" the user to have control on the desired accuracy through the vertical "
"precision parameter."
