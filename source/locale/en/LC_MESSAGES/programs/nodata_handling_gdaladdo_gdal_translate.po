"for nearest resampling, for each target pixel, one of the potential "

"for bilinear, cubic, cubicspline and lanczos, for each target pixel, the "
"weights of contributing source pixels is set to zero to ignore them when "
"they are masked. There is an extra specificity for cubic: given that some"
" of the weights in the kernel are negative, such strategy could lead to "
"strong overshoot/undershoot when there is an alternance of valid and "
"invalid pixels. Consequently, if any of the horizontal or vertical "
"direction, if the maximum number of valid source pixels in each dimension"
" is less than the radius of the resampling kernel, the target pixel is "
"considered as nodata."

"for the other resampling methods, source pixels contributing to the "
"target pixel are ignored if masked. Only the valid ones are taken into "
"account. If there are none, the target pixel is considered as nodata."
