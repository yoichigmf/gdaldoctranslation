"This is a read-only reader for RPF products, like CADRG or CIB, that uses"
" the table of content file - A.TOC - from a RPF exchange, and exposes it "
"as a virtual dataset whose coverage is the set of frames contained in the"
" table of content."

"In some situations, :ref:`raster.nitf` tiles inside a subdataset don't "
"share the same palettes. The RPFTOC driver will do its best to remap "
"palettes to the reported palette by gdalinfo (which is the palette of the"
" first tile of the subdataset). In situations where it would not give a "
"good result, you can try to set the RPFTOC_FORCE_RGBA environment "
"variable to TRUE before opening the subdataset. This will cause the "
"driver to expose the subdataset as a RGBA dataset, instead of a paletted "
"one."

"the subdataset with the same setting of RPFTOC_FORCE_RGBA as the one you "
