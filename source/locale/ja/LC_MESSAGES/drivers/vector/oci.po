"explicitly listed in the datasource name. Even in databases where all "

"As well two special commands are supported via the ExecuteSQL() "
"interface. These are \"**DELLAYER:<table_name>**\" to delete a layer, and"

"check to a layer. Internally these pseudo-commands are translated into "
"more complex SQL commands for Oracle."

"If an attribute called OGR_FID exists in the schema for tables being "
"read, it will be used as the FID. Random (FID based) reads on tables "
"without an identified (and indexed) FID field can be very slow. To force "
