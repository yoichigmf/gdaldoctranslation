"It is proposed that a set of functions or methods are written for raster "
"band objects to support \"raster algebra\", i.e., a set of operations, "
"which modify bands or compute values from bands. An example of a "
"modification is adding a value to all the cells of the band. An example "
"of a computation is the maximum cell value in the band. Operations may or"
" may not take arguments, in addition to the band itself, and if they "
"take, the argument may be a numeric value, a data structure, or another "
"band. Similarly, the computed value may be a simple numeric value, a data"
" structure, or another band."
