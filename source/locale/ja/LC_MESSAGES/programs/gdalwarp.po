"By default :program:`gdalwarp` uses a linear approximator for the "
"transformations with a permitted error of 0.125 pixels. The approximator "
"basically transforms three points on a scanline: the start, end and "
"middle. Then it compares the linear approximation of the center based on "
"the end points to the real thing and checks the error. If the error is "
"less than the error threshold then the remaining points are approximated "
"(in two chunks utilizing the center point). If the error exceeds the "
"threshold, the scanline is split into two sections, and the approximator "
"is recursively applied to each section until the error is less than the "
"threshold or all points have been exactly computed."
