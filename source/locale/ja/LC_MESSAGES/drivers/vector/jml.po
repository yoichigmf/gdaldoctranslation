".jml is a variant of GML format. There is no formal definition of the "
"format. It supports a single layer per file, mixed geometry types, and "
"for each feature, a geometry and several attributes of type integer, "
"double, string, date or object. That object data type, used for example "
"to store 64 bit integers, but potentially arbitrary serialized Java "
"objects, is converted as string when reading. Contrary to GML, the "
"definition of fields is embedded in the .jml file, at its beginning."

"OpenJUMP uses an optional string attribute called \"R_G_B\" to determine "
"the color of objects. The field value is \"RRGGBB\" where RR, GG, BB are "
"respectively the value of the red, green and blue components expressed as"
" hexadecimal values from 00 to FF. When reading a .jml file, OGR will "
"translate the R_G_B attribute to the Feature Style encoding, unless a "
"OGR_STYLE attribute is present. When writing a .jml file, OGR will "
"extract from the Feature Style string the color of the PEN tool or the "
"forecolor of the BRUSH tool to write the R_G_B attribute, unless the "
"R_G_B attribute is defined in the provided feature. The addition of the "
"R_G_B attribute can be disabled by setting the CREATE_R_G_B_FIELD layer "
"creation option to NO."
