"GDAL is the most central piece of `Critical Digital Infrastructure`_ in "
"the geospatial world, serving as the primary building block for data "
"management and processing in open source, commercial, and government "
"geospatial software. But most of its resources have gone to the "
"development of new features, while the maintenance burden has only "
"increased with more functionality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/sponsors/faq.rst:18
msgid ""
"The purpose of sponsor funding is to provide substantial long-acting "
"resources that give the project the ability to address software, testing,"
" and project challenges that do not attract individual sponsorship "
"attention. With a pool of resources that are not earmarked for features, "
"it can attack usability, performance, and modernization challenges that "
"benefit everyone. Sustained funding enables multi-year efforts that do "
"not disrupt the existing GDAL user base, and it will provide the baseline"
" resources to allow day-to-day maintenance operations to continue "
"uninterrupted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/sponsors/faq.rst:27
msgid ""
"The larger funding levels enabled by sponsorship aim to help GDAL grow to"
" a team of maintainers, as is typical in other leading open source "
"projects. The past few years have seen only one maintainer, who has been "
"stretched thin. The resources provided by this effort allow maintenance "
"activities to continue *and* allow the project to support on-boarding "
"additional developers to tackle various needs of the project that have "
"been ignored due to lack of direct funding interest."

"`NumFOCUS <https://numfocus.org>`__ is a US-based 501(c)(3) tax-exempt "
"non-profit that is already managing funding for many individual software "
"projects using this model such as Numpy, Jupyter, pandas, Julia, and "
"SciPy. They have staff, policies, procedures, and infrastructure for "
"managing the financial support of open source software projects with this"
" funding model. Many organizations in the initial list of sponsors are "
"already funding projects through NumFOCUS, and adding GDAL to the roster "
"improves efficiency on their side."

"`OSGeo <https://www.osgeo.org>`__  does not have staff and procedures to "
"manage tracking workloads and payments. OSGeo also does not provide tax-"
"exempt status for contributions. NumFOCUS has established relationships "
"with a large number of the initial sponsors. These properties are why the"
" GDAL PSC has chosen the NumFOCUS path for management of this effort."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/sponsors/faq.rst:63

"Not exactly. GDAL will be a project within NumFOCUS under the \"Grantor-"
"Grantee Model\". OSGeo is still the primary foundational \"home\" of GDAL"
" such as it is, but NumFOCUS is providing this financial vehicle and "
"service to the project under the purview of its charter."

"The GDAL PSC will control the purse strings. Contributors seeking "
"resources will submit a proposal to the PSC (RFC-style, but not public) "

"A significant portion (25% per year if possible) of the resources will be"
" targeted toward *growing* new active developers into the project. "
"Examples of this include soliciting ticket and code contributors with "
"funding if they show interest and aptitude, and providing resources to "
"mentor and support junior developers who are working into roles in the "
"project.  These activities are extremely hard to do without financial "

"The funds cannot be used to benefit an individual contributor or be "

"example, a fictional Imagery Corp cannot fund NumFOCUS with explicit "
"intent to have those resources used to fix bugs or add features that "

"A primary goal of this effort is to provide resources needed to allow the"
