"This driver allows accessing subdatasets derived from a given dataset. "
"Those derived datasets have the same projection reference, geo-transform "
"and metadata than the original dataset, but derives new pixel values "
"using gdal pixel functions."

"band. Nevertheless, even if not reported, those derived datasets are "
