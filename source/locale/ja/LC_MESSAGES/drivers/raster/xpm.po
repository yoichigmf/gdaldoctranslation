"GDAL includes support for reading and writing XPM (X11 Pixmap Format) "
"image files. These are colormapped one band images primarily used for "
"simple graphics purposes in X11 applications. It has been incorporated in"
" GDAL primarily to ease translation of GDAL images into a form usable "
"with the GTK toolkit."

"The XPM support does not support georeferencing (not available from XPM "
"files) nor does it support XPM files with more than one character per "
"pixel. New XPM files must be colormapped or greyscale, and colortables "
"will be reduced to about 70 colors automatically."
