msgid ""
"There is a need to have an instrument in GDAL which on the one hand "
"provides an abstraction for different existed network formats (pgRouting,"
" OSRM, GraphHopper, SpatiaLite networks, etc.), like GDAL (previously "
"OGR) provides one for spatial vector formats, and on the other hand "
"provides a network functionality to those spatial formats which does not "
"have it at all (Shapefiles)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/development/rfc/rfc48_geographical_networks_support.rst:40
msgid ""
"Such instrument is implemented as a separate set of C++ classes, called "
"GNM. The two main of them represent an abstract network (GNMNetwork "
"class) and the network of ”GDAL-native” or generic format "
"(GNMGenericNetwork class). An abstract network is used by user as a "
"common interface to manage his network data. The list of underlying "
"format-specific classes can be extended anytime like a list of GDAL "
"drivers to support more network formats. The ”GDAL-native” format "
"implements the abstract network and is used to provide the network "
"functionality to the spatial formats which are already supported by GDAL."
" All the network data of this format is stored in the special set of "
"layers along with spatial data in a spatial dataset (internally "
"GDALDataset and OGRLayer are widely used)."
