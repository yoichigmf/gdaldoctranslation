"TIGER/Line files are a digital database of geographic features, such as "
"roads, railroads, rivers, lakes, political boundaries, census statistical"
" boundaries, etc. covering the entire United States. The data base "
"contains information about these features such as their location in "
"latitude and longitude, the name, the type of feature, address ranges for"
" most streets, the geographic relationship to other features, and other "
"related information. They are the public product created from the Census "
"Bureau's TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and "
"Referencing) data base of geographic information. TIGER was developed at "
"the Census Bureau to support the mapping and related geographic "
"activities required by the decennial census and sample survey programs."

"Note that the TIGER/Line product does not include census demographic "
"statistics. Those are sold by the Census Bureau in a separate format (not"
" directly supported by FME), but those statistics do relate back to "
"census blocks in TIGER/Line files."

"To open a TIGER/Line dataset, select the directory containing one or more"

"The reader was implemented for TIGER/Line 1998 files, but some effort has"

"2002, 2003 and 2004 TIGER/Line products as well. The 2005 products have "
"also been reported to work fine. It is believe that any TIGER/Line "
"product from the 1990's should work with the reader, with the possible "
"loss of some version specific information."

"With a few exceptions, a feature is created for each record of a "

"The TIGER/Line RT (record type), and VERSION attributes are generally "
"discarded, but the MODULE attribute is added to each feature. The MODULE "
"attribute contains the basename (eg. TGR26001) of the county module from "
"which the feature originated. For some keys (such as LAND, POLYID, and "
"CENID) this MODULE attribute is needed to make the key unique when the "
"dataset (directory) consists of more than one county of data."
